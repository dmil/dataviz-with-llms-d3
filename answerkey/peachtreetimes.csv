georgia-peachtreetimes-662505644,C.D. Marsden,2024-08-09,Metric Media Network,Peach Tree Times,Georgia,"A representative of the Georgia Bankers Association (GBA) said that pending federal credit card regulations would negatively impact consumers by reducing competition and jeopardizing credit card security.The bill, S. 1838, or the “Credit Card Competition Act” (CCCA, S. 1838), would require banks to offer merchants at least two network options, one of which cannot be Visa or Mastercard, for processing credit card transactions. Opponents to the bill argue that if given the choice, retailers would likely choose cheaper, less secure networks for processing transactions, thereby exposing consumers to increased securities and fraud risks.  ""The Georgia Bankers Association strongly opposes the Credit Card Competition Act,"" Katina Weiss, GBA's marketing and communications manager, told Peach Tree Times. ""We believe it would harm consumers, reduce competition, and negatively affect banks.""""The bill would jeopardize credit card security by forcing banks to use potentially less secure networks, increasing the risk of fraud and compromising consumer data,"" said Weiss.Weiss shared a letter to Congressional leadership that her organization signed in September 2023 calling S. 1838 an ""anti-consumer, anti-competitive"" bill that is a ""cynical attempt by the largest global merchants and biggest grocery chains to obtain a subsidy for themselves at the expense of smaller competitors and consumers.""""Make no mistake: this bill was specifically written to deliver a major payday for big retail and big grocery at a time that these giant retailers have been getting even bigger, increasing their profits, and raising prices on American consumers,"" said the letter.Weiss said the GBA has communicated the organization's opposition to S. 1838 to both of Georgia's U.S. Senators, Jon Ossoff (D) and Raphael Warnock (D).She also said the legislation would ""jeopardize credit card security by forcing banks to use potentially less secure networks, increasing the risk of fraud and compromising consumer data.""Georgia ranked No. 3 in the country for per-capita credit card fraud reports in 2023, reported Peach Tree Times in April. Glenn Grossman, the Director of Research at financial advisory firm Cornerstone Advisors, concurred that if the CCCA is passed, it could lead to an increase in credit card fraud.“If the CCCA were to be approved, the routing of credit card transactions would move from a ‘single pipe’ to ‘multiple pipes’ of data flowing from merchants to issuers,” Grossman told Federal Newswire.“Today, card issuers depend on the networks to profile and identify fraud. They see all the transactions on their network and have developed fraud detection capabilities that would not be possible in a fragmented structure the CCCA would create,” Grossman said.Grossman added that Visa has invested billions on fraud detection.“The investment builds trust and in return consumers use their credit cards,” said Grossman. ""Zero liability means something to consumers. With the CCCA, it is possible that promise is gone.""In a report released in July 2023, “The True Impact of Interchange Regulation: How Government Price Controls Increase Consumer Costs and Reduce Security,” Grossman wrote that studies show 79% of consumers choose credit cards as a payment option because of their data security.Grossman said that, under the legislation, credit card authorizations would be allowed to flow across many “pipes” which would eliminate much of the “fraud fighting value that Visa and MasterCard have implemented.”The bill would not require new networks to provide fraud detection, Grossman explained.“It is expected these new networks would rather just route data, not ensure the authorization is legitimate. It is a fraudster’s dream come true!” he said.The Federal Trade Commission reported receiving 114,348 complaints of fraud in which the payment method was credit card in 2023. Those fraud complaints accounted for $246.1 million.The FTC also reported receiving 416,582 reports of credit card identity theft in 2023.The bill is currently pending before the Senate’s Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.Where did your state rank in 2023 rank for credit card reports per capita?Source: WalletHub / Federal Trade Commission dataStateCredit Card Fraud Reports per CapitaFlorida22.01District of Columbia21.76Georgia19.59Nevada18.3California16.08Delaware15.95Pennsylvania15.06Texas13.37Maryland13.05South Carolina12.79New York12.65Louisiana12.51New Jersey12.46Illinois12.44Arizona11.21Alabama10.62Massachusetts10.01Michigan9.52North Carolina9.52Connecticut9.41Mississippi8.98Virginia8.95Ohio8.86Colorado7.78Rhode Island7.77Indiana6.95Tennessee6.68Nebraska6.09Kansas6.04Washington5.8Arkansas5.75Missouri5.66Oregon5.53New Hampshire5.48Wisconsin5.41Utah5.08Minnesota5Oklahoma4.89Hawaii4.8Iowa4.69Kentucky4.3New Mexico4.29North Dakota4.22Idaho4.02Wyoming3.82Maine3.78Montana3.76Alaska3.64West Virginia3.63Vermont3.49South Dakota3.33","Georgia Bankers Association: Federal credit card regulations 'would harm consumers, reduce competition, and negatively affect banks'",https://peachtreetimes.com/stories/662505644-georgia-bankers-association-federal-credit-card-regulations-would-harm-consumers-reduce-competition-and-negatively-affect-banks,7.000268,5.1378746

This counting will occur after ballots have been tabulated but before results are submitted to county election offices.If upheld against potential legal challenges, this rule would necessitate counting an estimated 1.5 million ballots as part of the poll closing procedure. For comparison, Georgia voters cast 1.4 million ballots at polling places on Election Day in 2022.The SEB also considered a similar rule for Early Voting but did not approve it. The proposed changes have faced opposition from various entities including Georgia’s Voter Registration Election Officials (GAVREO), Secretary of State Raffensperger, and the Georgia Attorney General’s office. Concerns include potential delays in results, errors due to fatigued employees, retraining requirements for poll workers close to the election, and questions about whether these rules exceed the Board’s statutory authority.During recent meetings, the SEB has been suggesting changes to Georgia’s election certification process—a process trusted by Georgia voters for years. These proposals include allowing local officials to make an “inquiry” before certification without defining what “inquiry” means.Susannah Goodman, director of election security at Common Cause, responded with a statement:“It’s important that Georgia voters understand what this means.“In this context, ‘hand counting’ actually means counting the number of ballots one-by-one, not hand tallying all the votes for each candidate in all races.“Introducing this new rule just weeks before the presidential election is likely to cause confusion and expense. It will add delays on election night as workers at each polling place have to implement a new and unfamiliar poll-closing process.

georgia-peachtreetimes-664830236,Peach Tree Times,2024-10-08,Metric Media Network,Peach Tree Times,Georgia,"Marli Collier, managing director of Airlines 4 America (A4A), said policymakers should protect credit card travel reward programs from “unnecessary regulations,” as the U.S. Senate now considers two bills that could impact such programs for Georgia residents. U.S. Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) last month introduced the “Protect Your Points” Act, which comes in addition to his proposed “Credit Card Competition Act” (CCCA) that Collier said could threaten credit card rewards programs for Georgians.“Airline credit card rewards play an invaluable role in helping to grow Georgia's travel and tourism industry,"" Collier told Peach Tree Times in August. ""Consumers love their rewards cards because they get great value with them, but the Durbin-Marshall Credit Card Competition Act would threaten credit card rewards programs, undermine jobs and negatively impact economic growth across Georgia.”The CCCA, S. 1838, would require banks to offer merchants at least two network options, one of which cannot be Visa or Mastercard, for processing credit card transactions. In addition to impacting credit card reward programs, opponents of the bill say that if given the choice, retailers would likely choose cheaper, less secure networks for processing transactions, thereby exposing consumers to increased securities and fraud risks.  More than 385,000 travelers used credit card reward points to visit Georgia in 2022, according to a report released by Collier’s group.  The report said that 385,251 visitors used credit card reward points to visit the state in 2022, which supported 5,690 Georgia jobs and had a total economic impact of $650.6 million.These numbers were compiled via a survey of A4A’s member companies. Durbin’s new bill would empower the U.S. Department of Transportation and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to enforce new regulations and mandates on airlines, such as prohibiting accrued aware points and miles from expiring, requiring airlines to give a one-years head notice to consumers of any changes to terms of service with frequent flyer programs, new mandates requiring disclosing the financial value of points-per-mile on web sites, among other provisions.""U.S. airlines have been working to Protect Our Points for years against those working to eliminate these loyalty programs,” Collier told Peach Tree Times. “Consumers have the power of choice when selecting an airline, and carriers want to reward travelers for their return business and brand loyalty.”“Because there is fierce competition among airlines for customers, loyalty programs are a way carriers can say ‘thank you’ to travelers,” she said. “Millions of people voluntarily opt-in to enjoy various loyalty programs, which allow them to accumulate rewards to apply toward travel or other benefits.”Collier said that the airline industry is not the only one using rewards or loyalty programs, citing big box retailers, hotels, restaurants and small businesses. “U.S. airlines are transparent about these programs, and policymakers should recognize their popularity and work to ensure that unnecessary regulation doesn’t eliminate them,” said Collier.Durbin and U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), the other sponsor of the CCCA, held a hearing in May focused on credit card rewards programs. The Electronic Payments Coalition (EPC), a group representing U.S. banks, credit unions, and payment card networks, said the hearing was requested by Durbin and Marshall as “retribution” for airlines’ opposition to the CCCA. “This hearing is just the latest stop on Senators Durbin and Marshall’s ongoing retribution tour,” said EPC Chair Richard Hunt in a statement. “When the tide is against them, they resort to weaponizing the federal government against American companies opposing their attempts to place new government mandates on your credit card.”S. 1838 is currently pending in the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.",Airline Trade Group: Policymakers should ‘ensure unnecessary regulation doesn’t eliminate’ credit card reward programs for Georgians,https://peachtreetimes.com/stories/664830236-airline-trade-group-policymakers-should-ensure-unnecessary-regulation-doesn-t-eliminate-credit-card-reward-programs-for-georgians,6.6517243,5.157733

Brian Kemp, voted with the board's lone Democrat, Sara Tindall Ghazal, appointed by the state Democratic Party. Voting in favor were Dr. Janice W. Johnston, appointed by the state GOP; Rick Jeffares, appointed by the state Senate; and Janelle King, appointed by the state House.Other features of the new rule include assurance of ""one person-one vote,"" and it guards against certification of inaccurate or erroneous results, such as double scanning of ballots.Further, through the process of reconciliation, the number of voters to ballots from all methods of voting - absentee, advance voting and on election day - must match. At each precinct, the Board will compare the number of unique names by each voting method to the number of ballots cast of each type.In urging the Board to adopt the rule, Coach Weinhaus wrote, ""'One person - one ballot' is the foundation of a trustworthy electoral system. The Georgia legislature recognized this principle and mandated reconciliation before computing the votes on those ballots. This concept fosters public confidence in the electoral process by guaranteeing that no one’s voice is unduly amplified or diluted.

""ERIC also helps states reach out to potentially eligible but not yet registered individuals with information on how best to register to vote.""Hayden Ludwig, the director of policy research for Restoration for America, wrote in a column that, “ERIC was supposedly designed to help states cull their lists of voters who've died, moved or otherwise become ineligible.”""Here's the truth: ERIC was created to expand the nation's voter rolls, not clean them,"" Ludwig wrote. ""Take it from ERIC founder and leftist elections lawyer David Becker, who bragged in 2018 that '(ERIC) is the single most effective voter registration drive in the history of the United States,' responsible for adding, in ERIC states, 'between five and six million (new voters) in just six years.'""Ludwig wrote that, ""Newly acquired public records reveal that there's much more to the exact relationship between … (ERIC) and the Center for Election Innovation and Research (CEIR) than meets the eye. Emails obtained by the Public Interest Legal Foundation (and archived here) show Rhode Island Elections Director Rob Rock 'working with CEIR' 'to facilitate the secure transfer of . . . ERIC member data' to this private, third-party organization run by ERIC founder and ex-board member David Becker.""Legal Newsline reported that Becker has been described as a “hard-core leftist” who “hates conservatives."" Becker resigned from the ERIC board in March, following the resignation of four states from ERIC during that month alone.Ohio was one of those states, and Ohio Secretary of State Frank La Rose cited ERIC's ""hyper-partisan allies"" as a reason for his state's resignation from the program.""I cannot justify the use of Ohio's tax dollars for an organization that seems intent on rejecting meaningful accountability, publicly maligning my motives and waging a relentless campaign of misinformation about this effort,"" wrote La Rose in a letter to Shane Hamlin, executive director of ERIC. ""The conduct of ERIC and some of its hyper-partisan allies in recent weeks only heightens my suspicion and reinforces my decision.""Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Missouri, West Virginia, Virginia, Iowa, and Texas all resigned their memberships in 2023.Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin cited ""partisan concerns"" for his state's resignation.""The announcement comes amid concerns raised by citizens, government watchdog organizations and media reports about potential questionable funding sources and that possibly partisan actors may have access to ERIC network data for political purposes, potentially undermining voter confidence,"" said Ardoin in a press release.CNN reported, ""The controversy swirling around the group also prompted David Becker - a founder of ERIC - to announce … that he was resigning his non-voting position on the group's board after conservatives claimed his presence had injected partisanship in the group.""Is Your State a Member of ERIC?StateMember of ERICAlabamaNoAlaskaYesArizonaYesArkansasNoCaliforniaNoColoradoYesConnecticutYesDelawareYesFloridaNoGeorgiaYesHawaiiNoIdahoNoIllinoisYesIndianaNoIowaNoKansasNoKentuckyYesLouisianaNoMaineYesMarylandYesMassachusettsYesMichiganYesMinnesotaYesMississippiNoMissouriNoMontanaNoNebraskaNoNevadaYesNew HampshireNoNew JerseyYesNew MexicoYesNew YorkNoNorth CarolinaNoNorth DakotaNoOhioNoOklahomaNoOregonYesPennsylvaniaYesRhode IslandYesSouth CarolinaYesSouth DakotaNoTennesseeNoTexasNoUtahYesVermontYesVirginiaNoWashingtonYesWest VirginiaNoWisconsinYesWyomingNoSource: State statutes and policies, Electronic Registration and Information Center",Analysis: Georgia among 24 states affiliated with 'hyper-partisan' voter data group,https://peachtreetimes.com/stories/661984255-analysis-georgia-among-24-states-affiliated-with-hyper-partisan-voter-data-group,9.31646,-2.5153954

These amendments, which have the potential to alter the state constitution, are crucial decisions that only voters can make.Senator Blake Tillery has highlighted the significance of these amendments, noting their impact on daily life. ""These amendments are literally changing our state constitution, and only the voters of Georgia can make that happen,"" he stated.One amendment under consideration is Proposed Constitutional Amendment 1 (H.R. 1022 and H.B. 581). This measure aims to cap annual increases in home assessed values based on inflation. It also proposes a local sales tax option for property tax relief, shifting some tax burdens from property taxes to sales taxes. This could help homeowners avoid steep property tax hikes as home values rise.Proposed Constitutional Amendment 2 (H.R. 598 and H.B. 1267) seeks to establish a new court system, the Georgia Tax Court, for handling tax-related cases. Currently managed by the Georgia Tax Tribunal, this amendment would transition it into the judicial branch with expanded authority over appeals and other issues. Senator Tillery expressed skepticism about the necessity of another court system.Additionally, a Statewide Referendum Question (H.B. 808) asks whether personal property tax exemptions should increase from $7,500 to $20,000. This change would allow businesses and individuals to exclude up to $20,000 worth of tangible personal property from taxation—a potential benefit for small businesses and individuals owning work-related equipment.Senator Tillery emphasized that while these amendments may not be prominent parts of the ballot, they significantly affect taxes and state judicial structure: ""Georgia’s Constitution isn’t something we amend lightly—so make sure your voice is heard on these important issues.""Senator Blake Tillery serves as Chairman for the Senate Committee on Appropriations and represents Georgia's 19th Senate District.For media inquiries regarding these proposals or other legislative matters, contact SenatePressInquiries@senate.ga.gov.",Georgia voters face key constitutional amendments impacting taxes and judicial structure,https://peachtreetimes.com/stories/665319277-georgia-voters-face-key-constitutional-amendments-impacting-taxes-and-judicial-structure,1.4172193,4.5319386

Brian Kemp (R-Ga.) supported a ban, and stated that he intended to ""protect fairness in school sports"" when he signed a law in 2022 reinstating the Georgia High School Association's authority to prohibit transgender athletes, according to The Associated Press. Even though the association has banned boys from participating in girls' sports, there is no state law prohibiting it.As of publication time, there are 25 states that allow boys to participate in girls’ high school sports: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin.In April of 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to overturn a lower court ruling that had blocked West Virginia’s enforcement of its law, signed into law in April 2021, that banned boys from participation in girls’ high school sports. Those court rulings are expected to be challenged.In December 2022, a federal appeals court rejected a challenge to Connecticut’s policy of allowing boys to participate in girls’ sports. A lawsuit was filed in 2022 by three high school girls against the state’s policy, saying it was unfair. Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), the non-profit providing legal representation to the three girls, said it’s considering a challenge to the ruling.“Girls deserve to compete on a level playing field,” ADF Legal Counsel Christiana Holcomb said. “Forcing them to compete against boys isn’t fair, shatters their dreams and destroys their athletic opportunities.”There has been rapid growth in diagnoses of ""gender dysphoria"" in recent years, with a Reuters analysis of Medicaid findings that 42,000 children and teens in the U.S. received a diagnosis in 2021 – nearly triple the amount from 2017.""Overall, the analysis found that at least 121,882 children ages 6 to 17 were diagnosed with gender dysphoria from 2017 through 2021,"" Reuters said.A 2016 review in the Journal of Adolescent Health called children with gender dysphoria ""singularly vulnerable"" due to high rates of depression, self-harm and even suicide. The American Psychiatric Association's ""Diagnosfic and Stafisfical Manual of Mental Disorders"" says children are not fully capable of understanding what it means to be a man or a woman, adding that most questioning their biological sex eventually come to accept it and stop ""identifying"" as the opposite one.The issue of gender dysphoria and school sports hasn't been limited to high school. In March 2022, University of Pennsylvania male swimmer Will ""Lia"" Thomas won the women's NCAA swimming championship in the 500-yard freestyle.University of Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines, who tied with Thomas in the 200-meter freestyle event at those NCAA championships, called Thomas a “cheat.”“Lia Thomas is not a brave, courageous woman who EARNED a national title,” Gaines tweeted. “He is an arrogant, cheat who STOLE a national title from a hardworking, deserving woman. The NCAA is responsible.”Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who in April 2021 signed legislation banning boys from participating in girls’ sports, slammed Thomas' participation in women's events as an effort to ""destroy women's athletics.""""The NCAA's actions serve to erode opportunities for women athletes and perpetuate a fraud against women athletes as well as the public at large,"" the proclamation read.

On Tuesday, August 13, President Pro Tempore John F. Kennedy chaired the first Senate Advancing Forest Innovation in Georgia Study Committee meeting, dedicated to exploring how Georgia can continue to lead in the nation’s forestry sector.At the initial meeting at the Georgia Forestry Association Headquarters, groundwork was laid for addressing pressing issues facing Georgia forestry, particularly shrinking markets for forestry products. Many families in Georgia rely on forestry and forestland investments not only for their daily lives but also to achieve long-term goals such as homeownership, education, retirement security, and maintaining a good standard of living. The challenges impact landowners, businesses, and communities throughout Georgia.Central to the discussions was the need for innovation and adaptation in response to these challenges. The committee is committed to ensuring that Georgia's forestry industry remains a cornerstone of its economy by exploring new technologies, sustainable practices, and emerging markets. The goal is not merely to maintain current standings but to grow and lead globally.Speakers emphasized advocating for Georgia’s 22 million acres of working forests and protecting private property rights of forest landowners. Their insights highlighted the industry's significant role in the state's economy and underscored creating a favorable business environment for producers. These presentations provided a comprehensive understanding of Georgia’s forestry sector's current state.The committee's work aims at more than economic growth; it seeks to ensure an industry that supports countless families and communities across Georgia remains viable. Notably exciting is the potential for Georgia to influence Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) development significantly. With global SAF demand rising, Georgia’s vast forest resources offer unique opportunities for pioneering advancements in this field.A key aspect of discussions included learning about environmental benefits provided by working forests. These forests contribute economically while playing crucial roles in carbon sequestration, biodiversity support, and water quality preservation—central elements promoting sustainable practices within the industry.Over coming months, the committee will delve deeper into these issues with input from various experts, industry leaders, and community stakeholders. Recommendations from these discussions aim to guide leveraging vast forest resources economically beneficially and environmentally responsibly.Senator John F. Kennedy expressed honor in leading this committee: ""I’m honored to lead this committee and look forward to the progress we will make together.""More information about the committee’s work and upcoming meetings can be found online.Senator John F.

georgia-peachtreetimes-665413608,Peach Tree Times reports,2024-10-23,Metric Media Network,Peach Tree Times,Georgia,"The federal 340B drug program is estimated to reduced state and local tax revenues by $3.5 billion annually, on top of reductions in federal tax revenue. That's according to an analysis by Dan Crippen, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office, who wrote a report for the Alliance for Integrity and Reform of 340B. ""Even at current levels, the 340B Program results in a large transfer of taxable income to non-profit entities,"" Crippen wrote. ""As a result, last year alone, federal and state tax revenues were reduced by as much as $17B.""""The value of the 340B discounts is estimated to be $70 billion last year alone,"" said Crippen. ""When state and local taxes are included in the calculation, the average combined tax rate for pharmaceutical manufacturers is roughly 25 percent. The addition to the tax rate results in a possible reduction of state and local tax revenue by $3.5B per year.""Georgia has 75 hospitals participating in the 340b program, which is a federal initiative that enables eligible hospitals and healthcare organizations to purchase outpatient medications at significantly discounted prices.The 340B drug pricing program was created in 1992 to support uninsured or low income patients by enabling 340B covered entities like hospitals or health care organizations to purchase drugs for eligible patients at lower costs, passing on those savings to the patients. Since inception, there has been little oversight added to the program, leading to hospitals and health care institutions pocketing the savings instead of lowering costs for patientsThe 340B ACCESS Act was proposed to address these issue, and would add new requirements for transparency and eligibility to protect 340B patients. The legislation provides a clear definition of which patients are 340B eligible as well as a detailed list of requirements for hospitals to be eligible for participating in the 340B program. ""Today, despite its purpose, hospitals are using the program as a cash cow, racking up profits without passing the savings on to patients, as Congress intended,"" Dean Clancy, a senior health policy fellow at Americans for Prosperity, said in a recent Americans for Prosperity blog post. ""According to one comprehensive study, discounts reach as few as 1.4% of patients.""""The estimated dollar value of total 340B drug sales has grown from $7 billion in 2012 to $54 billion in 2022,"" Clancy wrote. ""Tellingly, from 2018 to 2023, while non-340B sales grew by 41.4%, 340B sales grew by 129.4%, more than three times as fast.""A 2022 Milliman analysis revealed that outpatient medicine costs at 340B hospitals are over 150% higher than at non-340B hospitals. These larger facilities, found more often in affluent areas, provide less charity care than non-340B hospitals.""The 340B Program has grown by double digits every year over the last five years,"" said Crippen. ""Unlike many other off-budget programs, the indirect impacts of the 340B Program on the federal budget and the deficit have not been documented. The effects of the 340B Program, however, are nonetheless contributing to the federal deficit.""While much of the growth of the 340B program can be attributed to more hospitals and patients partcipating in the program, Crippen also notes in his report that a lack of oversight has contributed to the increase of cost across the program. ""In 2018, GAO audited a sample of hospitals participating in the 340B program and found HRSA had a lack of clear definitions, a lack of rigorous enforcement of 340B requirements, and a lack of guidance.""""GAO continued that this unconstrained environment has likely contributed to 340B transactions that are inappropriate,"" Crippen wrote.

He will share this role with State Representative Matt Dubnik (R-Gainesville). This leadership change follows the retirement announcement of State Representative David Knight (R-Griffin), ending his 19-year legislative career. State Senator Russ Goodman (R-Cogdell) will continue to serve as the caucus co-chair in the Senate.“As a lifelong hunter and lover of the outdoors, it is truly an honor to serve alongside Rep. Dubnik and Sen. Goodman as co-chairs of the Georgia Legislative Sportsmen’s Caucus,” said Rep. Cannon. “As far back as I can remember, some of my most cherished memories are with my dad in an early morning duck blind, on a late afternoon dove field or in the clear and cold piney quail woods. Hunting and shooting have been, and continue to be, a significant part of my family’s tradition. I think it is vitally important for the sportsmen in our state to have legislators under the Gold Dome who are familiar with the outdoor pursuits of hunting, fishing, shooting and trapping. It’s equally important to have legislators who understand the policy issues surrounding those sporting activities. Georgia is home to some outstanding outdoor traditions, and I hope to continue protecting and promoting those. I want to thank Rep. Knight for his past leadership of the caucus, and I look forward to serving with Rep. Dubnik and Sen. Goodman in being a voice for Georgia’s sportsmen and women. Together, we will work to enhance sporting conservation policy and safeguard Georgia’s rich sporting heritage by ensuring the interests of hunters, anglers, recreational shooters and trappers are well-represented by pro-sportsmen legislators in the Georgia General Assembly.”The Georgia Legislative Sportsmen’s Caucus was established in 2004 in coordination with the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation (CSF). It continues to work directly with CSF and is united with other state-level sportsmen’s caucuses through the CSF-administered National Assembly of Sportsmen’s Caucuses (NASC). Since its inception in 2004, NASC has expanded to all 50 states and now includes more than 2,400 pro-sportsmen legislators from across the country.Founded in 1989, CSF serves as an authority on outdoor issues and influences public policy through partnerships with organizations such as Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus (CSC), Governors Sportsmen's Caucus (GSC), and NASC.

The council's third meeting of the year addressed recovery efforts following Hurricanes Helene and Milton, as well as discussions on Georgia’s agriculture industry and the role of natural gas in supporting agribusiness recruitment and retention.“In the light of the devastation caused by Hurricanes Helen and Milton, our recent meeting in Americus was an essential step in addressing the challenges rural Georgians are now facing as our rural communities that were some of the hardest hit by the storms,” said Rep. Greene. “Agriculture represents Georgia’s leading industry, and we must focus on supporting the recovery efforts and protecting the long-term growth of our rural farming communities. The discussions we held on the farming industry, the pivotal role of natural gas and how these resources can strengthen agribusiness recruitment and retention were vital to our council’s efforts to gather insights for proposing meaningful legislation in the upcoming session that not only aids in immediate recovery but also lays the groundwork for sustainable growth.”The two-day meeting began with a focus on how Hurricanes Helene and Milton impacted rural Georgia’s natural resources and agriculture sector. Discussions emphasized prioritizing relief for those affected by these storms. Georgia’s Agricultural Commissioner Tyler Harper highlighted issues such as labor shortages, national security, and mental health challenges faced by farmers. He noted that Hurricane Helene caused $3.2 billion in damage to Georgia's agriculture and forestry industries. Additionally, reforestation efforts due to hurricane losses were discussed by the Georgia Forestry Association.Beyond recovery efforts, agribusiness experts engaged with council members about tort reform's financial implications for farmers in rural areas. Legislative recommendations aimed at reducing accounting burdens on municipalities were also presented. Updates from Georgia’s banking association on local government financial reporting were shared alongside insights into workforce development related to both forestry industry updates and United States Farm Bill status.The House Rural Development Council was established in 2017 to collaborate with rural communities on strategies fostering economic growth and job creation.

georgia-peachtreetimes-661671387,Peach Tree Times,2024-07-06,Metric Media Network,Peach Tree Times,Georgia,"As President Biden revealed new rules regarding Title IX protections in April of 2024 which redefined “sex” to include “gender-identity,” and would require U.S. schools and colleges to include males who identify as females in female specific spaces like locker rooms and bathrooms, an analysis by the Peach Tree Times shows that Georgia is one of 25 states that allow boys to play in girls' high school sports.Gov. Brian Kemp (R-Ga.) supported a ban, and stated that he intended to ""protect fairness in school sports"" when he signed a law in 2022 reinstating the Georgia High School Association's authority to prohibit transgender athletes, according to The Associated Press. Even though the association has banned boys from participating in girls' sports, there is no state law prohibiting it.As of publication time, there are 25 states that allow boys to participate in girls’ high school sports: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin.In April of 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to overturn a lower court ruling that had blocked West Virginia’s enforcement of its law, signed into law in April 2021, that banned boys from participation in girls’ high school sports. Those court rulings are expected to be challenged.In December 2022, a federal appeals court rejected a challenge to Connecticut’s policy of allowing boys to participate in girls’ sports. A lawsuit was filed in 2022 by three high school girls against the state’s policy, saying it was unfair. Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), the non-profit providing legal representation to the three girls, said it’s considering a challenge to the ruling.“Girls deserve to compete on a level playing field,” ADF Legal Counsel Christiana Holcomb said. “Forcing them to compete against boys isn’t fair, shatters their dreams and destroys their athletic opportunities.”There has been rapid growth in diagnoses of ""gender dysphoria"" in recent years, with a Reuters analysis of Medicaid findings that 42,000 children and teens in the U.S. received a diagnosis in 2021 – nearly triple the amount from 2017.""Overall, the analysis found that at least 121,882 children ages 6 to 17 were diagnosed with gender dysphoria from 2017 through 2021,"" Reuters said.A 2016 review in the Journal of Adolescent Health called children with gender dysphoria ""singularly vulnerable"" due to high rates of depression, self-harm and even suicide. The American Psychiatric Association's ""Diagnosfic and Stafisfical Manual of Mental Disorders"" says children are not fully capable of understanding what it means to be a man or a woman, adding that most questioning their biological sex eventually come to accept it and stop ""identifying"" as the opposite one.The issue of gender dysphoria and school sports hasn't been limited to high school. In March 2022, University of Pennsylvania male swimmer Will ""Lia"" Thomas won the women's NCAA swimming championship in the 500-yard freestyle.University of Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines, who tied with Thomas in the 200-meter freestyle event at those NCAA championships, called Thomas a “cheat.”“Lia Thomas is not a brave, courageous woman who EARNED a national title,” Gaines tweeted. “He is an arrogant, cheat who STOLE a national title from a hardworking, deserving woman. The NCAA is responsible.”Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who in April 2021 signed legislation banning boys from participating in girls’ sports, slammed Thomas' participation in women's events as an effort to ""destroy women's athletics.""""The NCAA's actions serve to erode opportunities for women athletes and perpetuate a fraud against women athletes as well as the public at large,"" the proclamation read. ""Florida rejects the NCAA’s efforts to destroy women’s athletics, disapproves of the NCAA elevating ideology over biology and takes offense at the NCAA trying to make others complicit in a lie.""––Does Your State Ban Boys From Girls’ Sports?StateBoys Banned From Girls' Teams?AlabamaYesAlaskaYesArizonaYesArkansasYesCaliforniaNoColoradoNoConnecticutNoDelawareNoFloridaYesGeorgiaNoHawaiiNoIdahoYesIllinoisNoIndianaYesIowaYesKansasYesKentuckyYesLouisianaYesMaineNoMarylandNoMassachusettsNoMichiganNoMinnesotaNoMississippiYesMissouriYesMontanaYesNebraskaNoNevadaNoNew HampshireNoNew JerseyNoNew MexicoNoNew YorkNoNorth CarolinaYesNorth DakotaYesOhioYesOklahomaYesOregonNoPennsylvaniaNoRhode IslandNoSouth CarolinaYesSouth DakotaYesTennesseeYesTexasYesUtahYesVermontNoVirginiaNoWashingtonNoWest VirginiaYesWisconsinNoWyomingYes",Analysis: Georgia one of 25 states allowing boys to play girls’ high school sports,https://peachtreetimes.com/stories/661671387-analysis-georgia-one-of-25-states-allowing-boys-to-play-girls-high-school-sports,10.562921,-1.9027137

With over half of our state’s third graders struggling to read on grade level, this is a systemic issue that impacts families statewide. The Georgia Council on Literacy’s work is vital in providing educators with early interventions, resources, and support.

It’s a team effort, and together we can ensure every child has the opportunity to read and thrive.”Sen. Hickman shared his thoughts on the event: “Seeing the excitement in the eyes of these students as they engage with reading is exactly why we established the Georgia Council on Literacy. Literacy is the foundation for success, and initiatives like Georgia Reads Day help ensure that every child in Georgia has the opportunity to unlock their full potential through the power of reading.

Notably, this number does not include migrants who crossed the border undetected. 8 million of these encounters occurred at the southwest border. BBC notes that under the Trump administration there were only 2.4 million encounters. On March 24th of 2021, President Biden tapped Vice President Harris “to lead our efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle…in stemming the movement of…migration to our southern border.” The New York Post reported that the Department of Homeland Security had reported over 400 migrants brought into the country from Central Asia or other places by a human smuggling network that had tied to ISIS.

Kemp joined state and local emergency management officials, local leaders, and others in Savannah to provide an update on the response to damage from Debby. The State of Emergency issued by Governor Kemp has been extended for another seven days through Thursday, August 15, making state resources available to local governments and entities within the impact area. The Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency (GEMA/HS) State Operations Center is now at a level 2 partial activation. Teams from the Georgia National Guard, Department of Public Safety, Department of Natural Resources, Georgia Department of Agriculture, and Georgia Department of Transportation are also working closely with affected counties to monitor damage and deploy as needed. The governor and emergency management officials are also coordinating with Georgia's utility providers, who have been responding to any power outages homes and businesses may experience.“While the worst of Debby has passed, this remains an active situation,” said Governor Brian Kemp. “I'm grateful for all of our first responders, utility providers, and others who have already been in impacted areas ensuring people are safe, roads are passable, and necessary repairs are made. We want to encourage all Georgians affected by the storm to be patient in allowing these men and women to do their work and return communities to full operation.""The Governor and GEMA/HS are strongly encouraging residents to stay off roads. Residents should follow the instructions of local officials. If advised to evacuate, do so immediately. Do not drive around barricades; they are there for your safety. Never drive through standing water as it only takes one foot of water to float a full-sized automobile, and two feet can sweep it away. More than half of flood victims are in vehicles swept away by moving water. Move to higher ground away from rivers, streams, creeks, and storm drains. Stay out of floodwaters if possible as the water may be contaminated or electrically charged. Stay away from downed power lines to avoid the risk of electric shock or electrocution.Debby is currently projected to continue moving northeast as it dissipates. Though rain is no longer falling, rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water will just now be cresting. Debby dropped over a foot of water on much of south and coastal Georgia. Several rivers in Southeast Georgia have active flood warnings which could persist through the weekend.The State Operations Center activated over the weekend allowed the state to move resources ahead of the storm. A State of Emergency was issued Saturday, August 3rd making state resources available to local governments in impacted areas. On Monday, August 5th the Governor issued an additional executive order enabling the Georgia National Guard to call up troops.GEMA/HS is at level 2 partial activation actively working with federal, state, and local partners determining best steps for safety measures including conducting drone missions for assessment purposes.The Georgia National Guard’s response effort consisted of approximately 300 Soldiers and Airmen assisting Screven County among others with various tasks ranging from route clearance to transport using high-water vehicles.GDOT crews assess impacts on roads while DNR responded with search-and-rescue operations including staging boats due concerns over dam failure at Lake Eureka.DPS monitored road conditions maintaining a list closures while GDA worked alongside partners ensuring citizen safety monitoring agricultural impacts such as crop losses including significant poultry fatalities reported across several counties.Both ports operated by GPA resumed activities post-storm ensuring continued logistical operations crucial during recovery efforts.___",Governor Kemp extends state emergency following tropical storm Debby,https://peachtreetimes.com/stories/662606217-governor-kemp-extends-state-emergency-following-tropical-storm-debby,4.2350645,3.6971323

These members released the following statement:“Our hearing offered a vital platform for a diverse range of voices, including students, parents, and advocacy groups, to present their perspectives on the initial denial and subsequent approval of the AP African American Studies course.

The concern revolves around whether this development would violate Georgia state law, specifically O.C.G.A. § 43-18-72.This provision mandates that crematories must be situated at least 1,000 feet away from any residential subdivision that is platted and recorded with the superior court. Upon investigation, it was found that the proposed site is only 427 feet from Dallis Court Townhomes, 539 feet from homes on Abingdon Drive, and 636 feet from Hearthstone Trace.While zoning issues typically fall under local jurisdiction, when there is potential for state law violation, intervention becomes necessary. The matter was reviewed with the Georgia Office of Legislative Counsel to confirm the specifics of the law and determine if any exemptions apply.

""Firearms are the only equalizer for women who wish to defend themselves from harm."" Roman’s comments come amid reports of Vice President Kamala Harris’ history including her support for Australia’s national firearms laws, which don’t consider self-defense as a legitimate reason for gun ownership, and her past support for Washington DC’s self-defense handgun ban, which was subsequently declared unconstitutional. According to a report from the Peach Tree Times, there are currently an estimated 350,000 gun owners in Georgia that aren't registered to vote in the upcoming Presidential election between Vice President Harris and Former President Trump. The report noted that gun owners are more likely to be Republicans, and could be a key voting bloc in the upcoming election.According to a recent report from the Center Square, Vice President Harris has a history of supporting restrictions on firearms and the second amendment. As San Francisco District Attorney, Harris led a group of prosecutors in urging the Supreme Court to uphold Washington DC's total handgun ban, which was found unconstitutional. Harris, as Vice President, spoke favorably of Australia's gun restrictions which do not consider self-defense as a ""genuine reason"" for gun ownership. Recent studies have shown an increase in women purchasing and owning guns. According to data from Harvard University, between 2019 and 2021 about half of all gun purchases were made by women and new gun owners were more likely to be female during that period. Data from Gallup, reported by Fox News, found that the percentage of women reporting that they owned a gun rose from 15% to 22% between 2016 and 2022.There are currently 7,135,681 active registered voters in Georgia. In 2020 the presidential election in Georgia was decided by 11,779 votes, according to the GA Secretary of State.

At the same time, Governor Brian Kemp, Commissioner Tyler Harper, and Colonel Billy Hitchens issued a reminder about the upcoming enforcement of the Georgia Hemp Farming Act. The law, which includes public safety restrictions on hemp products manufactured and sold in Georgia, will take effect on October 1.The General Assembly passed the act in March. The law introduces age restrictions on the possession of consumable hemp products and mandates that retailers, wholesalers, and manufacturers obtain a license to operate within the state. It also includes other testing and regulatory requirements.As of October 1, it will be illegal to sell consumable hemp products to individuals under 21 years old. Additionally, those under 21 will not be allowed to purchase or possess these products. These new restrictions aim to protect young Georgians' health and safety.“Here in Georgia, the safety of our residents is top priority, especially that of our children and young people,” said Governor Kemp. “Consumable hemp products are dangerous to minors and unregulated hemp products are a danger to all Georgians. Knowing these dangers, I want consumers to be aware of these new laws and know that all law enforcement officers in the State will be enforcing them starting October 1st. I’m grateful to the General Assembly for passing this legislation that puts in place necessary guardrails to protect Georgia’s children and communities as this industry evolves and want to thank the Department of Agriculture and all public safety agencies across Georgia for working hard to implement this new framework effectively.”“Our team at the Georgia Department of Agriculture was proud to work with Governor Kemp, the General Assembly, and other Law Enforcement Agencies from across the state to protect Georgia consumers and children by establishing much-needed guardrails for consumable hemp products in our state,” said Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper. “The laws regarding under-21 sales and the sale of raw flower products are very straightforward and will be strictly enforced by our Law Enforcement and Hemp Program Divisions as well as other state and local law enforcement starting October 1st.”“Through our traffic enforcement across Georgia, the Department of Public Safety (DPS) is committed to applying the new law set by the General Assembly and strongly supported by Governor Kemp regarding limitations placed on consumable hemp products,” said Colonel William W. Hitchens III, DPS Commissioner. “We take the safety of our residents and visitors seriously and will carry out our duties which will include enforcing the restrictions set by the Georgia Hemp Farming Act.”The law introduces necessary public safety measures following Congress legalizing hemp production through its inclusion in the 2018 Farm Bill. Hemp is a cannabis plant containing small amounts of psychoactive cannabinoid delta-9 THC alongside other natural cannabinoids used medicinally. Consumable hemp products like oils, gummies, and beverages have been sold with little oversight or quality control standards.State law enforcement agencies urge citizens and public safety officers alike to familiarize themselves with these new restrictions along with proposed rules from Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper outlining comprehensive standards for hemp production.A copy of The Georgia Hemp Farming Act can be found here along with proposed rules from The Department Of Agriculture regarding Hemp here.It should be noted that this act does not affect Georgia's medical cannabis program or patients registered under its Low-THC Oil registry.",Georgia enforces new age restrictions on consumable hemp starting October 1,https://peachtreetimes.com/stories/664621148-georgia-enforces-new-age-restrictions-on-consumable-hemp-starting-october-1,3.4187376,4.5229497

This overall rise in prices has placed additional financial strain on households across the state, making everyday expenses more challenging to manage.In 2022, the high rates of inflation significantly reduced the real value of American wages, leading to widespread financial concerns, according to Statista. Many Americans expressed anxiety over the economy and reported worsening financial conditions. The inflation crisis in the United States, mirrored globally, was largely driven by COVID-19-related supply chain disruptions and the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In June 2022, the U.S. monthly inflation rate soared to a 40-year high of 9.1%, with annual inflation for the year reaching 8%. Without corresponding wage increases, Americans will continue to experience a decline in purchasing power. Since then, inflation has been cooling at a slow pace, but it still hovers above pre-pandemic levels. In June 2024, it reached 3%, with American families facing a CPI more than 20% higher than in January 2020.Comparison of Georgia Inflation Costs by Sector for July 2024: Increase Since January 2021Total InflationTransportationShelterEnergyFood$1,074$1,074$276$276$264$264$125$125$125$125Cost of Living: State-by-State Inflation Comparison from January 2021 to July 2024RankStateTotal Inflation Rate (January 2021 to July 2024)Extra Spending per Household (January 2021 to July 2024)1Arizona21.8%$32,6251Colorado21.8%$36,7031Idaho21.8%$29,8811Montana21.8%$30,9151Nevada21.8%$32,5441New Mexico21.8%$28,1811Utah21.8%$35,6181Wyoming21.8%$31,7879Delaware21.7%$30,2959District of Columbia21.7%$41,3139Florida21.7%$31,2439Georgia21.7%$27,4279Maryland21.7%$30,8559North Carolina21.7%$25,9539South Carolina21.7%$25,2199Virginia21.7%$29,5319West Virginia21.7%$22,67418Alabama21.2%$24,14718Kentucky21.2%$23,94718Mississippi21.2%$22,49518Tennessee21.2%$25,31822Arkansas20.6%$21,29122Louisiana20.6%$23,95422Oklahoma20.6%$22,14322Texas20.6%$27,88926Iowa20.5%$25,66226Kansas20.5%$27,80926Minnesota20.5%$31,66026Missouri20.5%$28,08126Nebraska20.5%$28,71026North Dakota20.5%$28,95326South Dakota20.5%$28,90733Illinois20.5%$29,54033Indiana20.5%$25,77133Michigan20.5%$26,65033Ohio20.5%$25,40933Wisconsin20.5%$25,87538Alaska19.6%$31,84438California19.6%$31,98338Hawaii19.6%$30,92338Oregon19.6%$24,32838Washington19.6%$27,26843New Jersey18.6%$27,87743New York18.6%$27,38743Pennsylvania18.6%$23,46046Connecticut17%$27,53646Maine17%$22,20646Massachusetts17%$28,99246New Hampshire17%$27,40946Rhode Island17%$23,67046Vermont17%$23,414* Rounded values for better visualization.",Georgia inflation rate outpaces national average as of July 2024,https://peachtreetimes.com/stories/663762697-georgia-inflation-rate-outpaces-national-average-as-of-july-2024,7.2396274,7.88448

This devastating loss serves as a stark reminder of how dangerous this law is—putting our healthcare providers in direct conflict with the Hippocratic Oath they swore to uphold, all while they fear the risk of prosecution. As a result, the trust that people have in their doctors erodes, and the access to essential care becomes dangerously limited.I am angry when I consider that in a state like Georgia—a place with so much to offer and a history of setting powerful examples for the rest of the country—this is what we are becoming known for. We can and we must do better.Fighting for a woman’s right to agency over her own body is a fight for our collective humanity. It transcends politics, dogma and division.

Albers. “When the legislative session begins in January, I will introduce legislation to increase penalties for deadbeat parents and ensure that anyone who cannot meet their legal, moral, and ethical obligations as a parent is disqualified from running for or serving in elected office.”The proposed legislation will address the growing issue of parents who neglect their financial responsibilities. A “deadbeat parent” is defined as a parent who willfully fails to pay child support, disregarding court orders or legal agreements, and thereby neglecting their duty to provide for the basic needs of their children. Sen. Albers’ initiative seeks to impose significant consequences on those who evade their responsibilities, reinforcing the importance of child welfare and the integrity of public office.More details on the proposed legislation will be released as the 2025 Legislative Session approaches.Sen. John Albers serves as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Public Safety. He represents the 56th Senate District which includes portions of Cherokee, Cobb and North Fulton counties.

This includes 350,897 Georgian gun owners. President Joe Biden surpassed former President Donald Trump by 11,779 votes in Georgia during the 2020 election, according to the Georgia Secretary of State.Data on gun ownership from Statista found that gun owners are more likely to be Republicans than Democrats. The data showed that 48% of Republicans report that they own at least one gun, and 66% said they lived in a household with a gun. Responses from Democrats said only 20% reported they owned a gun and 31% said they lived in a household with a gun. Katie Baney, Chairman of the Board & Executive Director of the U.S. Concealed Carry Association for Saving Lives Action Fund, wrote in an op-ed for the Daily Caller that ""one sizable voter bloc that can and should significantly impact the elections is law-abiding gun owners"" and that ""the gap between Second Amendment advocates and detractors is growing wider by the day."" Baney also further wrote that the Biden-Harris administration has called for ""sweeping bans"" on firearms that are the most common choices for home and self-defense.As of July 18th, Real Clear Politics shows the Presidential race in Georgia is within single digits with Trump taking between a 1 point and 6 point lead depending on the poll.

georgia-peachtreetimes-662077290,Peach Tree Times,2024-07-23,Metric Media Network,Peach Tree Times,Georgia,"Governor Brian P. Kemp announced today that S&P Global Ratings has reaffirmed Georgia's ""AAA with a stable outlook"" assessment for the state's creditworthiness. The announcement came at the start of an international trip to promote Georgia as a leading state for business and job creation.Due to the absence of new general obligation bonds issued for the current fiscal year, FitchRatings and Moody’s Investors Service did not issue formal reports on Georgia's bond ratings. Both agencies had previously awarded Georgia their highest possible ratings in their last analyses.""Once again, Georgia's responsible, conservative approach to budgeting has allowed our state to receive affirmation of the highest possible bond rating,"" said Governor Kemp. ""In the face of economic uncertainty on the national level due to bad policies coming out of Washington, D.C., I could not be more proud of our shared focus with the legislature on careful budgeting and maintaining a strong economic development pipeline that keeps Georgia a safe bet for any and all job creators.""S&P cited several factors contributing to their rating scores, including positive employment trends, strong budgetary performance, high reserve levels, and consistent funding of obligations. They also noted Georgia's willingness to make politically difficult decisions and its balanced approach to primary revenue sources.The S&P Global Ratings report highlighted that for a third consecutive year, Georgia generated a multi-billion operating surplus and maintained very strong reserve balances at its statutory limit of 15 percent of previous year net revenues. Despite expectations for near-term softening of broader U.S. economic activity and revenue conditions, S&P believes Georgia will carry this momentum through fiscal 2024 and into fiscal 2025.The report also emphasized Georgia's favorable population growth trends and its ability to attract diversified business developments within its large economic base. It projected annual growth rates that would match or outpace national averages.Georgia revised its five-year revenue projections (2024-2028), incorporating conservative revenue growth assumptions: 1.6% in fiscal 2025, 3.5% in fiscal 2026, 4.0% in fiscal 2027, and 4.3% in fiscal 2028. While these assumptions are deemed reasonable by S&P, they will continue monitoring long-term revenue effects from tax reductions on predictability and structural balance.The 'AAA' GO rating reflects:- Very strong governmental framework with authority to align expenditures with revenue projections.- Very strong financial management with sustainable processes for monitoring performance.- A large and diverse economic base benefiting from favorable population growth trends.- Strong budgetary performance with high reserves levels.- Adequate pension funding discipline despite relatively low combined pension funding levels compared with peers.The stable outlook incorporates expectations that Georgia will maintain structurally balanced budgeting amid potential near-term economic conditions changes while making timely adjustments if necessary.However, S&P cautioned that significant financial pressures could lower the rating if they result in substantial reserve spend-downs or weakened debt metrics due to long-term liability growth related to pensions or retiree health care costs.S&P views the state's debt burden as low-to-moderate with an expectation of stable-to-improving debt metrics over the next several years due to rapid amortization schedules and planned cash-funding for capital improvements in fiscal 2025.The full report is available here.",Georgia maintains AAA bond rating amid robust economic indicators,https://peachtreetimes.com/stories/662077290-georgia-maintains-aaa-bond-rating-amid-robust-economic-indicators,2.1537845,8.087165

They can only see the ballot images if they agree to drop the investigation into why there were over 20,000 unsubstantiated votes in both the original and machine recount in 2020,” Liz Harrington said in a Thursday post on X.Harrington referred to an email exchange which took in place in May, between Georgia Secretary of State’s Office General Counsel Charlene S. McGowan and Janice Johnston, a member of Georgia’s State Election Board.The conversation was in regards to an exhibit of 2020 Presidential Election recount data from December of that year, titled “Exhibit 11” – specifically, electronic images of nearly 519,000 ballots submitted in Fulton County, which Johnston had asked to be made available.Screenshots of the email exchange between McGowan and Johnston were attached to Harrington’s post.“I have discussed with the Chairman your request that the electronic ballot images provided by Fulton County in response to a subpoena in the referenced case be provided to you on a flash drive,"" McGowan wrote in a May 14 email. ""The Chairman and I agreed that the request can be treated as an Open Records Request. As we would respond to any ORR for these files, there are both chain of custody issues and security concerns with allowing electronic copies of election data files to be distributed among the public. Until I am sure that the files do not have any other data associated with them other than the ballot images, they cannot be released.""“However, we can make the files available for inspection, so long as the Board is in agreement that this case is fully resolved and closed,"" she continued.

If 2023-025 is a closed case, we can make them available to you to review at our office. You can schedule this inspection with Investigations, I would just ask that you limit the time involved to a few hours a week, so that it does not disrupt their regular job duties.”McGowan’s message did not satisfy Johnston.“Charlene’s email states that my request would be treated as an Open Records Request, but I did not receive a response,"" Johnston wrote back on May 29. ""I called [Georgia Secretary of State Office’s Chief Investigator] Sara Koth yesterday, and she had Investigator Gil Humes give me a call. Mr. Humes said that the images will available for me to review next week. I still do not understand how Exhibit 11 was listed in the Case Summary, which should have been available for all of the Board to review well before the meeting.” “Now I find that Exhibit 11 still not available.

The county acknowledged that “technical issues” occurred during the recount, including failure to properly follow protocols for backing up data to servers.”Subsequently, while the Office may not have all the ballot images, they do have all the physical ballots – currently preserved under seal, due to pending litigation.Harrington further posted on X on Thursday that “SEB-2023-025 shows Fulton County was 17,234 votes short during the machine recount, and its final results were missing 17,852 ballot images and included over 3,125 duplicates.”“The state wants to sweep it under the rug without ever showing the evidence,” Harrington said.",Former Trump spokeswoman: Secretary of State General Counsel is 'holding evidence hostage from the State Election Board',https://peachtreetimes.com/stories/662101039-former-trump-spokeswoman-secretary-of-state-general-counsel-is-holding-evidence-hostage-from-the-state-election-board,7.811568,-3.826207

Barnes. “I worked hard on this legislation last session, and seeing this report validates the need for this legislation and reinforces its importance.

The bill would authorize local boards of education and other public school governing bodies to offer driver education as an elective course worth one-half of an elective credit for students.

What is this doing? It’s sending a strand of synthetic RNA into the human being and is invoking within the human being, the creation of the S1 spike protein, which is a pathogen,” Martin told the Weston A. Price Foundation. “It’s a toxin inside of human beings. This is not only not keeping you from getting sick, it’s making your body produce the thing that makes you sick.”VAERS is a U.S. government database that collects and monitors reports of adverse events or side effects following vaccination, helping to track and assess the safety of vaccines. The system is owned and operated by multiple U.S. federal agencies, primarily the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in collaboration with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).By the admission of its creators, VAERS also underreports adverse events.“‘Underreporting’ refers to the fact that VAERS receives reports for only a small fraction of actual adverse events,” says the VAERS website. “The degree of underreporting varies widely.” Dr. Peter A.

The proposed Senate Bill 4944 was introduced in the United States Senate last week.“Georgia families urgently need more affordable housing. That’s why I’m introducing this new legislation that will help families build credit as renters and better position them to become homeowners,” Sen. Ossoff stated. “I thank Georgia State Representative Yasmin Neal for her steadfast advocacy on this issue and for working alongside me to draft this legislation.”“Doing right by the people and doing real work is at the core of the legislation me and Senator Ossoff pursue,” said Rep. Neal. “I am humbled that the Senator and his staff have been so open to exploring creative ways to help Americans get access to housing with me. Me, the Senator, and his staff have worked and had countless exhaustive meetings for two years to build housing measures that truly change people’s lives. This bill does just that. The percentage of Americans in rental homes is at an all-time high, and owning a home is the American dream; me and the Senator want to ensure that every American has a fair shot at that dream.”The legislation mandates landlords receiving federal financing through entities such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac for multifamily properties, including apartment buildings, provide tenants with the option to have their on-time rent payments reported to credit bureaus. These positive rental payments would be factored into risk assessment standards for Georgians applying for federally insured mortgages through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Additionally, Sen. Ossoff’s bill requires the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to submit a detailed report to Congress after five years, evaluating the program’s outcomes.More information on this initiative may be found here.",Rep.

""This is a $475 billion taxpayer-funded bailout for those with the highest earning potential. It's financially irresponsible, fundamentally unfair & still blocked from taking effect.""According to Reuters, a federal appeals court extended an order preventing President Joe Biden's administration from advancing its student debt relief plan. The plan aims to reduce monthly payments and expedite loan forgiveness. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis granted a broader injunction requested by seven Republican-led states, arguing that a lower-court order did not fully block the U.S. Department of Education's plan.The Biden-Harris Administration's proposed regulations aim to provide debt relief to federal student loan borrowers under certain conditions. According to the U.S. Department of Education, the relief targets borrowers who owe more than they did at the start of repayment, those who have been in repayment for long periods, individuals eligible for forgiveness but have not yet applied, and those who attended institutions that failed to meet financial value standards.Carr was appointed as Georgia's attorney general by then-Governor Nathan Deal in 2016 and was re-elected in November 2022. Since taking office, he has focused on addressing issues such as human trafficking, gang activity, and opioid misuse.

According to the latest data from the United States Congress Joint Economic Committee, the total monthly inflation rate in Georgia stood at 21.4%, surpassing the national rate.This rate indicates a significant rise in the overall cost of goods and services, resulting in an additional monthly cost of $1,060.The persistent increase in inflation has been driven by various factors, including supply chain disruptions, increased demand, and higher production costs. This overall rise in prices has placed additional financial strain on households across the state, making everyday expenses more challenging to manage.In 2022, the high rates of inflation significantly reduced the real value of American wages, leading to widespread financial concerns, according to Statista. Many Americans expressed anxiety over the economy and reported worsening financial conditions. The inflation crisis in the United States, mirrored globally, was largely driven by COVID-19-related supply chain disruptions and the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In June 2022, the U.S. monthly inflation rate soared to a 40-year high of 9.1%, with annual inflation for the year reaching 8%. Without corresponding wage increases, Americans will continue to experience a decline in purchasing power. Since then, inflation has been cooling at a slow pace, but it still hovers above pre-pandemic levels.

georgia-peachtreetimes-663997871,Nicholas Malfitano,2024-09-13,Metric Media Network,Peach Tree Times,Georgia,"A new lawsuit brought in a Georgia federal court alleges that Fulton County “does not maintain, nor does it even attempt to maintain, accurate voter rolls” and seeks to compel county and state authorities to abide by Georgia state law pertaining to elections and voter eligibility.“Fulton County does not maintain, nor does it even attempt to maintain, accurate voter rolls. Just months ago, during an on-record Fulton County Board of Commissioners hearing, questions were asked to the Chair of the Fulton County Department of Registration and Elections (FCDRE) concerning whether the FCDRE was fulfilling its lawfully compelled and non-discretionary duties regarding voter list maintenance,” read the lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia on Aug. 28.“When asked whether ineligible voters were being removed from the voter roll, FCDRE’s Chair admitted that ‘Fulton County never conducts an independent search for anybody; dead people, felons, [or even] people who live out-of-state.”The lawsuit was brought by Jason Frazier and Earl Ferguson versus the FCDRE, its Members Sherri Allen, Aaron Johnson, Michael Heekin and Teresa K. Crawford, its Registration Manager Kathryn Glenn and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.It alleges that Fulton County has violated the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), which mandates all states to “conduct a general program that makes a reasonable effort to remove the names of ineligible voters from the official lists of eligible voters.”Under Georgia state law pertaining to elections, plaintiff Frazier submitted a voter roll challenge on Aug. 4 to contest the continued inclusion of certain electors who are no longer eligible to vote in Fulton County—and was required to have received a response containing notice of a hearing within 10 business days of his challenge being received, but did not.“The issue here is that defendants, as a direct and proximate result of their communications with defendant Raffensperger, have conspicuously taken the NVRA’s aforesaid 90-day ‘quiet period’ and transposed the prohibition against removing ineligible voters identified by a state ran and operated systemic voter removal program and placed the prohibition upon any voters identified by a challenger’s use of a program that he or she uses in the [voter] challenge submission process,” the suit says.“Secretary Raffensperger has falsely advised and/or instructed that federal law prohibits county election officials in Fulton County and throughout Georgia’s remaining 158 other counties from removing voters within 90 days of a federal election, if the ineligible voters identified by a [voter] challenge were found to be ineligible based upon a challenger’s use of a program. But this is not what the NVRA says, and in the case of plaintiff Earl Ferguson, this is the precise basis upon which his [voter] challenge was rejected.”The suit seeks, in part, a writ of mandamus “declaring defendants have violated well-settled federal and state law; to enjoin defendants from further violating state and federal law, and to compel by way of mandamus relief each defendant named in this action to fulfill their express, non-discretionary duties as public elections officials in the State of Georgia.”Multiple requests for comment to plaintiffs' counsel went unanswered.Peach Tree Times has submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Secretary of State’s office for Fulton County voter rolls, including their list of potentially ineligible voters for the county to notify. A FOIA request was also submitted to the FCDRE asking for the same records along with the organization's status in notifying the voters on that same list.The climate in Georgia with respect to election integrity has been at a fever pitch since the 2020 Presidential Election and remains so in the lead-up to the November election. The Associated Press reported in June that conservative activists were advocating for the use of artificial intelligence-powered software to more quickly purge invalid registrations from voter rolls. Opponents of the concept say that voter protection and transparency associated with hearings for the challenge process would disappear, if that method were to be put into practice.That advocacy, and the plaintiffs’ lawsuit, came on the heels of a bill passed by Republican lawmakers in Georgia earlier this year, which would allow the removal of people from the voting rolls through challenges to voter eligibility.","Citizen lawsuit against election authorities: 'Fulton County does not maintain, nor does it even attempt to maintain, accurate voter rolls'",https://peachtreetimes.com/stories/663997871-citizen-lawsuit-against-election-authorities-fulton-county-does-not-maintain-nor-does-it-even-attempt-to-maintain-accurate-voter-rolls,7.3979077,-3.833489

Kemp hosted representatives from Georgia's healthcare industry for a roundtable discussion on civil litigation policies impacting the state's healthcare providers and affordability for Georgians. The event at Atrium Health's Macon campus was part of a series of listening sessions announced earlier this month.Participants included representatives from the Georgia Hospital Association, Georgia Medical Association, Georgia Health Care Association, and private practitioners.“Improving healthcare access and affordability has been one of my top priorities since day one of my administration,” said Governor Brian Kemp. “As part of our comprehensive approach to that issue, we are committed to hearing from healthcare practitioners on how the civil litigation climate in our state is impacting their ability to best care for Georgians. I'm grateful for their engagement on this topic as we look into how best to approach reform.”The first roundtable in August focused on small business leaders and the impacts of civil lawsuits on their operations. The initial step towards litigation reform began with the passage of the Data Analysis for Tort Reform Act during the 2024 legislative session, sponsored by Rep. Will Wade. This act created a mechanism to gather necessary information to guide further steps. Both chambers of the General Assembly also worked on legislation related to civil litigation, including SB 426 and SB 83.“I really appreciate the work from Governor Kemp, Lt. Governor Jones, Speaker Burns, and all members of the General Assembly for helping us move the ball forward last session,” said Insurance and Safety Fire Commissioner John King. “Lawsuit abuse reform is needed to ensure Georgia and its citizens stay in the forefront of states to do business.”Governor Kemp discussed challenges posed by current liability laws on the healthcare industry and patients in Georgia.“Georgia’s current healthcare liability laws are pulling vital resources away from our core mission – caring for patients and supporting our communities,” said Caylee Noggle, President and CEO of the Georgia Hospital Association. “While we firmly believe in holding providers accountable for patient care, many of these laws restrict access to care and threaten the survival of healthcare facilities across the state.""“On behalf of the Medical Association of Georgia, I want to thank Governor Brian Kemp for his focus on civil justice reform,” said Dr. Brett Cannon of the Medical Association of Georgia. “Georgia has a number of healthcare challenges exacerbated by the current legal climate.""“I am grateful to Governor Kemp for bringing together our state's top legislative leaders and representatives from across the healthcare continuum,” said Chris Downing, President and CEO of the Georgia Health Care Association.Participants discussed impacts on insurance rates and availability within the healthcare industry.

georgia-peachtreetimes-662197158,Peach Tree Times,2024-07-30,Metric Media Network,Peach Tree Times,Georgia,"Georgia saw 435 people die after receiving a “COVID-19” MRNA injection, according to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).Nationwide, 15,958 people have died under the same circumstances.The MRNA injections are more commonly known as “COVID-19 vaccines.” Dr. David Martin, founder and chairman of M-CAM Inc, said the “vaccines” are actually gene therapy.“It is not a vaccine. What is this doing? It’s sending a strand of synthetic RNA into the human being and is invoking within the human being, the creation of the S1 spike protein, which is a pathogen,” Martin told the Weston A. Price Foundation. “It’s a toxin inside of human beings. This is not only not keeping you from getting sick, it’s making your body produce the thing that makes you sick.”VAERS is a U.S. government database that collects and monitors reports of adverse events or side effects following vaccination, helping to track and assess the safety of vaccines. The system is owned and operated by multiple U.S. federal agencies, primarily the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in collaboration with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).By the admission of its creators, VAERS also underreports adverse events.“‘Underreporting’ refers to the fact that VAERS receives reports for only a small fraction of actual adverse events,” says the VAERS website. “The degree of underreporting varies widely.” Dr. Peter A. McCullough, a respected cardiologist and epidemiologist, has warned about adverse reactions from the COVID-19 MRNA injections.""It's my judgment at this point in time that the vaccine is the cause of death in a majority of cases,"" said McCullough in an interview with RedVoiceMedia.com ""I think it's fine for people to change their view of the vaccine and they should based on emerging data.""McCullough is an internationally recognized medical researcher in the field of the interactions between kidney function and heart function and related diseases, with more than 1,000 articles published, according to his biography at the information website Radcliffe Cardiology.Statistics represented in the story and corresponding graphs differ slightly due to streamlined data collection.Fatalities in America among the vaccinated in 2021 have increased by 76.05% from the previous decade.Data is accurate as of July 28.Georgia Deaths by Month After Receiving a VaccineMonthCOVID vaccine deathsOther vaccine deathsJan 2021210Feb 2021230Mar 2021220Apr 2021370May 2021400Jun 2021140Jul 2021130Aug 20211201Sep 2021600Oct 202180Nov 202180Dec 202151Jan 202250Feb 202220Apr 202210May 202230Jun 202210Jul 202210Aug 202250Sep 202261Oct 202230Nov 202210Dec 202230Jan 202340Feb 202310Oct 202332Jan 202410Feb 202410Apr 202404Georgia Deaths by Year After Receiving a VaccineYearCOVID vaccine deathsOther vaccine deaths202000202137122022311202382202424* Not all reported deaths had a date of death included, and they were excluded from the dataGeorgia Lives Lost by Age After Receiving a COVID-19 Vaccine010203040506070809010011049 and under50-5960-6970-7980-8990+","In Georgia, 435 people have died after receiving COVID-19 “vaccine”",https://peachtreetimes.com/stories/662197158-in-georgia-435-people-have-died-after-receiving-covid-19-vaccine,10.906557,7.9703803

This overall rise in prices has placed additional financial strain on households across the state, making everyday expenses more challenging to manage.In 2022, the high rates of inflation significantly reduced the real value of American wages, leading to widespread financial concerns, according to Statista. Many Americans expressed anxiety over the economy and reported worsening financial conditions. The inflation crisis in the United States, mirrored globally, was largely driven by COVID-19-related supply chain disruptions and the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In June 2022, the U.S. monthly inflation rate soared to a 40-year high of 9.1%, with annual inflation for the year reaching 8%. Without corresponding wage increases, Americans will continue to experience a decline in purchasing power. Since then, inflation has been cooling at a slow pace, but it still hovers above pre-pandemic levels.

The three members who planned the meeting did not post any notice in official forums or on the SEB website. Georgia Open Meetings law requires a minimum of seven days' notice for any public meeting in which rulemaking is discussed.In a statement regarding the secret SEB meeting, Aunna Dennis, executive director of Common Cause Georgia, said: ""Common Cause Georgia has championed the Open Meetings Act, and this illegal meeting is a violation of the act.""Dennis further commented on the implications for voters: ""Georgia voters should pay attention to the process of how the SEB are voting on provisions and rules. The chairman introduced a provision to create stop gaps on the type of information that could be gathered to delay the certification process and the board struck down the amendment. And now, they are holding secret meetings to push their political agenda. The public and voters should demand transparency and accountability of the SEB.""She added: ""As a result of yesterday’s meeting, the rule’s proposal was unnecessary and the adoption of it is a clear disregard for the concerns raised by organizations rooted in election transparency, and of the voters who have trusted the certification process thus far.""Dennis also highlighted potential delays in certification: ""Unfortunately, our certification process will move even slower than it previously has. On top of that, with the ability of the public to issue mass voter challenges online, many communities that were already targets will bear the brunt of what the SEB has just permitted yesterday.""She advised Georgia voters to ensure their documentation is up-to-date with the SOS office and to have copies readily available. Dennis concluded by urging voters to remember this incident at future elections: ""It is also critical that Georgia voters remember this disregard shown by the SEB, who was appointed by their elected representatives, at the ballot box in 2026.""###",State Election Board holds secret meeting violating Georgia's open meetings law,https://peachtreetimes.com/stories/661806009-state-election-board-holds-secret-meeting-violating-georgia-s-open-meetings-law,7.4039574,-3.2579744

Rep. Houston aims to inform voters in Berrien, Cook, and Tift counties about these tax relief initiatives that could alleviate property tax pressures.Rep. Houston stated, “I want to ensure that our community is fully informed about the amendments and referendum that will appear on the November ballot.” She emphasized the potential benefits of these initiatives and encouraged residents of House District 170 to consider them carefully before voting.One measure on the ballot is a ""floating"" homestead exemption under House Bill 581. This would limit annual property tax increases by tying assessed values to the Consumer Price Index. The exemption applies across all taxing authorities including city, county, and school taxes. Counties could also implement a Local Option Sales Tax (LOST) to further reduce or eliminate property taxes. The bill allows political subdivisions to opt out of this homestead exemption.Constitutional Amendment 1 seeks to enact HB 581 by amending the Constitution so that the General Assembly can offer a statewide homestead exemption applicable to all counties and local governments. If approved, this would introduce a new ""floating"" homestead exemption limiting annual assessment increases on homesteaded properties according to inflation rates.Constitutional Amendment 2 proposes allowing the Georgia Tax Court judicial power with statewide jurisdiction for handling tax law appeals more efficiently. Judges would be appointed by the governor for four-year terms subject to approval by legislative committees.The Statewide Referendum A aims to increase ad valorem taxation exemptions on tangible personal property from $7,500 to $20,000 in value—excluding motor vehicles, trailers, and mobile homes—from property taxes.Early voting began on October 15 and ends November 1 with Election Day scheduled for November 5.",Georgia voters face constitutional amendments and referendum questions in upcoming election,https://peachtreetimes.com/stories/665262015-georgia-voters-face-constitutional-amendments-and-referendum-questions-in-upcoming-election,1.3046517,4.4960785
georgia-peachtreetimes-664715067,Peach Tree Times reports,2024-10-02,Metric Media Network,Peach Tree Times,Georgia,"As U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reports 11,076 illegal alien encounters out of the Atlanta Field Office during fiscal year 2024, a new report shows illegal aliens may commit murder at rates 50% higher than the U.S. population. An article by John R. Lott, Jr. posted on RealClearPolitics highlights data on criminal activity among illegal aliens released into the U.S. According to ICE data, more than 435,000 convicted criminals and nearly 227,000 individuals with pending charges were allowed entry as of July 2024. These include thousands of individuals convicted of serious crimes such as homicide, sex offenses, and assault. “About 7.4 million noncitizens are in the “national docket data,” so 662,776 is 9% of the total, and if one extrapolates the numbers to the homicide rate in this country, it strongly indicates that the government is letting migrants into this country who commit murder at a rate 50% higher than the rest of the U.S. population,” Lott wrote.""And these numbers clearly underestimate the crime rate of these noncitizens. The noncitizens in the “national docket data” turned themselves in to border agents for processing or were caught,"" he continued. ""Those who don’t turn themselves in are obviously far more likely to have something to hide from those doing the processing, so-called “gotaways,” who are observed illegally entering the U.S. but not caught or turned back.""Lott suggests that the root of this problem lies in a broken and overwhelmed immigration system, where the lack of proper background checks has led to the release of individuals with dangerous criminal histories. ICE agents, facing overwhelming caseloads and limited resources, have admitted to struggling to process the sheer number of migrants. The contrast with the Trump administration’s ""Remain-in-Mexico"" policy, which enforced stricter vetting procedures, has led to accusations that the Biden administration’s lax policies have resulted in more violent criminals being released into the public.Furthermore, the administration’s transparency has come into question. According to Fox News, despite requests for accountability from lawmakers like Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-TX), the administration delayed responses for months regarding how many of these criminals entered the U.S. during Biden's tenure. Critics accuse the administration of attempting to downplay the severity of the border crisis, particularly following reports that some officials were instructed not to publicize arrests of migrants with ties to terrorism.The silence from the White House has only fueled outrage. Law enforcement officers and Republicans have expressed frustration at the administration’s lack of urgency, pointing out that these failures have created a dangerous situation for American citizens. Under the current policies, not only are convicted criminals being released, but the system also lacks mechanisms to track their whereabouts once they are set free.This has led to increased calls for reform, with Republicans and some border-state Democrats demanding stronger border security measures and more effective screening protocols. Critics argue that the administration’s reluctance to enforce strict immigration controls puts Americans at risk, particularly given that many of these migrants come from countries with little cooperation on background checks.According to an analysis of CBP Data, during fiscal year 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has arrested 45,402 illegal aliens who have previous criminal convictions or who are wanted by law enforcement. CBP has reported more than 2.7 million illegal alien encounters during Fiscal Year 2024, while there were only 646,822 in Fiscal Year 2020.","Illegal aliens 'commit murder at a rate 50% higher than the rest of the U.S. population,' analysis shows",https://peachtreetimes.com/stories/664715067-illegal-aliens-commit-murder-at-a-rate-50-higher-than-the-rest-of-the-u-s-population-analysis-shows,9.187962,3.405325

Allen West, Executive Director of the American Constitutional Rights Union and a former Congressman, said the Second Amendment is Georgians' “protection"" from “tyrants.” Col. West’s comments come amid reports of Vice President Kamala Harris’ history of being in favor of restrictions to Second Amendment rights including mandatory buybacks and bans on certain firearms including AR-15s and handguns. ""An armed individual is a citizen, a disarmed individual is a subject. The history of dictators, tyrants, and despots is that they prefer subjects,"" West said. ""The American Second Amendment is our protection from the goals, objectives, and desires of tyrants.""Vice President Harris has a history of supporting restrictions on firearms and the second amendment, according to a recent report from the Center Square. As San Francisco District Attorney, Harris led a group of prosecutors in urging the Supreme Court to uphold Washington DC's total handgun ban, which was found unconstitutional. Harris, as Vice President, spoke favorably of Australia's gun restrictions which do not consider self-defense as a ""genuine reason"" for gun ownership. According to Bloomberg, as a candidate for the Democratic nomination for President.

In it, federal health and disaster officials covering a range of topics centered around the idea that marginalized groups are being shortchanged by disaster relief services—in this case, based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.  ""Welcome to FEMA’s Disaster Preparedness Meeting. Tyler Atkins (He/They) — we’re unsure if this is a Biological Male or Female. Regardless, Atkins goes on a rant about how LGBTQIA Individuals are already struggling, outside of the impact of Natural Disasters,"" Sam Mitha said in a post on X. ""Apparently, The LGBTQIA Community is NOT being talked about enough, thus this conversation. This is a way to usher in more ‘Disaster Equity’ amidst these Storms. These Storms, just so everyone is aware, DO NOT discriminate who they negatively affect."" ""Incompetence & Delusion bolstered into Positions of Power. While these Clowns talk for HOURS about Diversity, Equity, & Including, people are SUFFERING. B*dies are piling up. Food & Supplies are dwindling. Now is GO TIME, not conversation time about Feelings,"" Mitha wrote. FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell makes it clear in the FEMA Strategic Plan for 2022-2026 that “Diversity, equity and inclusion cannot be optional.” Among the goals listed in FEMA's plan are to ""instill equity as a foundation for emergency management, lead whole of community in climate resilience and to promote and sustain a ready FEMA & prepared nation."" FEMA released a document in 2023 titled ""Equity in Disaster Relief"" - Achieving Equitable Recovery: A Post Disaster Guide.The document states 8 goals that are centered around building ""equity"" into the agency’s organizational and coordination structure in how to respond to disasters.  The first seven goals focus on using equity to ""define the agenda"" and to ""determine which segments of the community are underserved."" But the eighth goal in the document is an explicitly stated aim to ensure ""equitable"" distribution of aid.That goal speaks of ensuring “fair recovery outcomes” by “eliminating disparities” and developing mechanisms to “help focus resources where they are needed most.” Vice President Kamala Harris has defended the practice of distributing resources based on minority status as a necessary way to “fight for equity.” The viral video of FEMA's webinar comes amid increasing scrutiny of the organization in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Fox News reporter Sara Carter spoke with residents of Lake Lure and Chimney Rock, North Carolina and reported that, despite assurances from President Biden that flood victims were ""getting everything they need"" that the federal response has been underwhelming. FEMA is also facing backlash over Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas saying last week that FEMA, ""does not have the funds to make it through the season."" DHS this year diverted $640.9 million from Customs and Border Patrol to FEMA's Shelter and Services Program, which ""provides financial support to non-federal entities to provide sheltering and related activities to noncitizen migrants following their release from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS),"" According to FEMA's website.Mayorkas defended the actions of DHS and FEMA, citing that congress had approved the funds for FEMA to spend on immigration-related crises, not on hurricane aid, according to the New York Post.In response to Mayorkas' justification of FEMA's spending on the border crisis, Texas Governor Greg Abbott posted on X, ""This is easy.

The representative from Locust Grove released a statement commending Attorney General Chris Carr for his efforts in appealing the decision to overturn the act.Daniel stated, “Last week, I held a press conference at the State Capitol with Congressman Rich McCormick and State Senator Ed Setzler to discuss the outright lies being spread about Georgia’s LIFE Act, also known as the ‘heartbeat bill.’ The politically motivated rhetoric surrounding this issue is directly responsible for women hesitating to seek emergency care, and this behavior is inherently dangerous for all women in Georgia. My goal has always been to protect life by improving maternal and infant outcomes in the state of Georgia.”She emphasized that policymakers should focus on legislation that improves outcomes rather than spreading fear and misinformation. According to Daniel, “The LIFE Act protects women from predatory abortion practices and strikes a balance by providing exceptions for the life of the mother, cases of rape and incest and medically futile pregnancies. Our LIFE Act also never prohibits treatment for a miscarriage, and anyone saying otherwise is lying to you.”Daniel concluded by praising Attorney General Chris Carr's actions: “I commend Attorney General Chris Carr for appealing the decision to overturn Georgia’s LIFE Act and the Georgia Supreme Court for granting a stay while the courts further consider the measure.”",Georgia Supreme Court reinstates LIFE Act amid praise from Rep.

Carr made these remarks in an October 1 post on X.""This attack from Iran against Israel cannot be tolerated,"" said General Chris Carr. ""We must be unwavering in our support for Israel against those who seek to destroy her. There is no room to placate the forces of evil that wish to eliminate our freedoms.""According to the Associated Press, Iran launched at least 180 missiles into Israel on October 1. This incident is part of a series of escalating attacks between Israel and Iran, along with its Arab allies, which have increased the risk of a broader regional conflict. The involvement of Hezbollah and Hamas, both backed by Iran, has heightened concerns about the potential for a wider war.Carr has taken legal action by filing an amicus brief in support of a lawsuit under the Anti-Terrorism Act. This lawsuit is brought by survivors and families of victims of the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack. It seeks to hold American Muslims for Palestine (AMP) and National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP) accountable for allegedly providing material support to Hamas. Carr, along with 21 other attorneys general, argues against dismissing the case before discovery, underscoring the significance of the Anti-Terrorism Act in enabling victims to seek damages from those who support terrorism.Appointed as Georgia's attorney general by then-Governor Nathan Deal in 2016 and re-elected in November 2022, Carr has prioritized issues such as human trafficking, gang activity, and opioid misuse during his tenure. His initiatives include establishing Georgia's first Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit and Gang Prosecution Unit.

It also grants the courts the rights to rule on custody if a child in the state has ""been unable to obtain gender-affirming health care.""During a Townhall in 2019, as a candidate for the Democratic nomination for President, Harris pledged that she would target states that pass pro-life laws or attempt to put any restrictions on abortion in place.

georgia-peachtreetimes-662493318,Peach Tree Times reports,2024-08-12,Metric Media Network,Peach Tree Times,Georgia,"6 in 10 voters in seven battleground states, including Georgia, oppose Vice President Kamala Harris’ support for providing reparations to Black Americans.That’s according to a new poll released last week by American Greatness that surveyed voters in Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and North Carolina.Harris’ support for reparations for Black Americans is opposed by 60% of voters in those states, with only 27% supporting her stance. The American Greatness poll was conducted by North Star Opinion Research among 1400 likely voters, 200 per state, in each of the seven battleground states.  While running for U.S. President in 2019, then-U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) said she supported reparations for black Americans.""I think there has to be some form of reparations,"" said Harris in an interview with black online news site, The Root.When the interviewer asked Harris if, as president, she ""would be willing to lead a conversation on what reparations for Black people would look like,"" Harris replied, ""yeah.""This was just one of numerous times Harris has backed reparations for black people.“I’m serious about taking an approach that would change policies and structures and make real investments in black communities,"" she told the New York Times in February of 2019. During her time as a U.S. Sen. for California, Harris co-sponsored a bill with New Jersey Senator Cory Booker introduced in April 2019. This legislation aimed to create a commission to study impacts of slavery and ""ongoing discrimination against African-Americans,"" as well as make ""recommendations on reparation proposals for the descendants of slaves."" A potential goal outlined in the bill was to create a ""national apology and proposal for reparations for the institution of slavery and its continuing racial and economic discrimination against African-Americans.""Harris also told the Des Moines Register in 2019 that reparations would not be as simple as ""writing a check,"" and that research needed to be done in order to come up with solutions to address ""the systemic issues that are present and will continue to exist.""Harris was elected Vice President in 2020 alongside President Joe Biden (D). She was recently slated as the new Democrat candidate for the upcoming presidential election when Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed her. Before being elected as Vice President, Harris served as the District Attorney of San Francisco, the Attorney General of California, and as a U.S. Senator from California. ","Poll: Voters in battleground states, including Georgia, oppose Harris’ support for reparations",https://peachtreetimes.com/stories/662493318-poll-voters-in-battleground-states-including-georgia-oppose-harris-support-for-reparations,11.495027,3.4436843

georgia-peachtreetimes-664567392,Peach Tree Times,2024-09-26,Metric Media Network,Peach Tree Times,Georgia,"Criminal justice, including the ongoing YSL trial, is a significant concern for many Fulton County residents. They are awaiting the final cost of what has become the longest taxpayer-funded trial in Georgia's history under District Attorney Fani Willis.Georgia-based YouTubers like The Lead Attorney and national streamers like DJ Vlad attract millions to Fulton County daily to watch what some describe as a criminal justice soap opera. The YSL trial has become an international spectacle, highlighting what many see as a corrupt system that prioritizes itself over the people it represents, making it a case study for criminal justice reform.The right to a fair trial, competent prosecutors working on behalf of victims, and trials free from prosecutorial or judicial misconduct are fundamental elements of justice. However, these principles do not seem to apply equally for those jailed in Fulton County. Often, individuals are found guilty based on prosecutors' actions rather than allowing juries to weigh evidence and determine guilt or innocence through fair trials.Young Thug has exposed several issues during the YSL trial: secret judicial ex parte meetings resulting in his attorney being held in contempt; judges advising prosecutors on better objections; prosecutors intimidating witnesses with imprisonment threats if they impeach themselves after signing plea deals; alleged inappropriate relationships between investigating officers and witnesses; and District Attorney Fani Willis’ team being reprimanded by a judge for repeated lapses in prosecutorial rules knowledge.The YSL trial overshadows the good work of other Fulton employees and elected officials who strive to provide quality service and follow the law. Clear laws govern courts, judges, and prosecutors to ensure justice is served without prejudice or bias. This is especially important for marginalized individuals who feel overwhelmed by a system that appears indifferent to actual justice.As two RICO cases unfold in Fulton County—against Young Thug and former President Trump—there is concern they may end disastrously for one district attorney and millions of citizens funding them both. Any failure to address these injustices will be noticed in public opinion.""The time for complacency is over; the time for real justice is now,"" said State Representative Mesha Mainor. ""With the full weight of my office, the citizens of Fulton County demand immediate action.""Mainor called for expert policy guidance from organizations such as the Prosecutor Oversight Commission, Georgia Prosecuting Attorney Council, State Bar of Georgia, Judicial Qualifications Council, Georgia Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Judicial Council of Georgia, Council on Criminal Justice, and Council of State Governments Justice Center.To families affected by crime prosecuted in Fulton County: ""My office extends heartfelt condolences and sincere apologies for your pain,"" Mainor stated. ""When the system does not work, no one gets justice.""A comprehensive audit should be conducted on individuals currently detained in any Fulton County jail with specific focus on detainees meeting certain criteria:- Detained without bond hearing beyond 48 or 72 hours post-arrest.- Unable to post bond for more than 30 days without arraignment or plea hearing.- Incarcerated over 90 days without indictment.- Indicted but awaiting trial commencement beyond 120 days.- Individuals with intellectual/physical disabilities ensuring their federal rights are upheld.Additionally, District Attorney Fani Willis should implement written guidelines ensuring defendants understand their constitutional rights while being prosecuted:- Right to demand a speedy trial.- Right to petition for bond.- Right to submit complaints about her office’s conduct.For change involvement: Join State Representative Mesha Mainor at a special hearing on criminal justice reform at the State Capitol on Monday, October 7th from 3 p.m.–5 p.m., room 341.",State representative calls for action regarding fair trials at Fulton County jails,https://peachtreetimes.com/stories/664567392-state-representative-calls-for-action-regarding-fair-trials-at-fulton-county-jails,5.40897,-4.525838

georgia-peachtreetimes-661567295,Peach Tree Times reports,2024-07-05,Metric Media Network,Peach Tree Times,Georgia,"A analysis of food prices from the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) found that Americans, on average, are paying record high prices for their July 4th barbecues. Recent polling of Georgia voters found that they blame the Biden-Harris administration for the rise in grocery prices.The average cost of a July Fourth cookout for ten people in the South, which includes Georgia, this year is $68.33, according to the AFBF. According to the AFBF's annual Fourth of July market basket survey, the average cost for an Independence Day cookout for ten people in 2024 is a record-high $71.22, five percent higher than 2023's average of $67.73 and 30 percent higher than five years ago. According to the reports findings, this is the first time the average cost has surpassed $7 per person, with the total coming to $7.12 per person nationwide. Only two dishes in the report, chicken breast and potato salad, saw a decrease. All other foods rose in price.The AFBF's survey shows that two pounds of ground beef are up 11% over last year, surpassed only by the cost of 2.5 quarts of lemonade, which is up 12 percent over last year. Other notable increases include three pounds of pork chops (8%), hamburger buns (7%), 16 ounces of potato chips (8%), and a half-gallon of ice cream (7%). The same AFBF analysis for Fourth of July 2021 showed the average cost of an Independence Day cookout for ten people was $59.50. Prices were relatively stable over the previous year.

Gun violence has breached our front doors and invaded our schools, homes, and communities. It is a relentless epidemic that devastates lives and shatters our sense of safety. The question now is, “What are we going to do about it?”Georgia General Assembly, how many more teachers and students must die before we enact common-sense gun legislation? Schools are meant to be sanctuaries for our children, not battlegrounds where they practice military drills to stay safe. Our students are growing up in fear, which impairs their ability to learn and thrive. It’s time for decisive action.We need the Georgia General Assembly to step up and address our failing gun laws with urgency. It is crucial to work collaboratively with military and mental health professionals to tackle this crisis head-on.As I express my condolences to the families, students, teachers, and parents of Apalachee High School, my heart hurts. It was Apalachee High School yesterday, and it could be yours today.Here is what needs to be done:House Bill 4: HB 4 would establish an electronic inpatient bed registry through the Georgia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities. This would ensure real-time data on available mental health resources, improving our response to crises.House Bill 553: HB 553 would implement temporary ex parte risk protection orders to prevent individuals deemed a threat from accessing firearms, ammunition, and weapon carry licenses. This measure is crucial for stopping potential tragedies before they occur.House Bill 224: HB 224 would mandate that lost or stolen firearms be reported to law enforcement within five days. Failure to do so should result in a fine. This is a necessary step to prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands.House Bill 366: HB 366 would require gun owners to secure their firearms properly when not in use to prevent access by unauthorized users, especially children. Violations should be treated seriously with penalties to ensure compliance.House Bill 554: HB 554 would prohibit the sale of semiautomatic assault weapons to individuals under 21. It is a common-sense measure to keep dangerous weapons out of the hands of those too young to responsibly handle them.House Bill 555: HB 555 would ban devices that enable rapid fire on firearms. These accessories only increase the lethality of gun violence and have no place in our communities.House Resolution 56: HB 56 would acknowledge gun violence as a public health crisis and call for data-driven legislation to address it effectively. This resolution underscores the need for actionable and research-backed solutions.House Bill 7: HB 7 would establish a school-linked behavioral health grant program to provide essential mental health services within schools. Ensuring access to mental health support is crucial for preventing violence and supporting at-risk students.House Bill 8: HB 8 would adjust school attendance policies to consider mental and behavioral health. Recognizing and accommodating these needs will help ensure that students receive the support they require to succeed.The time for empty rhetoric is over. We need action that prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities. It’s time for the Georgia General Assembly to come together, put aside partisan divides, and implement these critical measures.

These changes would have allowed ""biological males to compete against females."" Carr made his statement in an August 22 post on X.""We've once again blocked the Biden-Harris administration's egregious Title IX rewrite from taking effect in GA,"" said General Chris Carr. ""President Biden & VP Harris tried to destroy women's sports by allowing biological males to compete against females. We fought back & won.""Carr provided a document from the United States District Court appeal for the Northern District of Alabama, where plaintiffs, including Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and four private organizations, filed a lawsuit to block the Title IX rule. The plaintiffs argued that the rule would cause irreparable sovereign, constitutional, and compliance harm. They claimed the rule conflicts with state laws and requires schools to implement harassment policies that might restrict student speech. The plaintiffs also argued that the rule would impose regulatory burdens on schools, requiring time, money, policy revisions, employee training, and potential litigation.The U.S. Department of Education released final Title IX regulations prohibiting sex discrimination in federally funded education programs and activities. According to the U.S. Department of Education, these regulations outline protections against sex-based harassment, including provisions related to sexual violence, pregnancy, sexual orientation, and gender identity. The regulations require schools to address complaints of discrimination, ensure fairness in their processes, and communicate nondiscrimination policies to students and families while maintaining certain privacy standards.Chris Carr was appointed as Georgia's attorney general by then-Governor Nathan Deal in 2016 and was re-elected in November 2022. Since taking office, Carr has focused on addressing issues such as human trafficking, gang activity, and opioid misuse.

georgia-peachtreetimes-661844979,Peach Tree Times,2024-07-15,Metric Media Network,Peach Tree Times,Georgia,"A recent report by the Georgia Public Policy Foundation has examined the health insurance marketplace in Georgia since Governor Brian Kemp took office. The report highlights significant improvements in the state's health insurance landscape, which was described as ""dire"" when Kemp assumed office in 2019.The analysis focuses on waivers submitted by Governor Kemp that established both Georgia’s reinsurance program and a state-based exchange called Georgia Access, currently managed by Georgia Insurance Commissioner John King. According to the report, “other governors should emulate Kemp’s success if they wish to seize power back from Washington, D.C., bring revenue to their states and use the power of the private sector.”In 2018, many Georgians faced challenges in obtaining individual health insurance due to a lack of insurers. Only four carriers operated on the individual market at that time, with 145 counties having just one insurer and 14 counties having two. This lack of competition led to higher insurance rates and lower reimbursement rates for providers.Governor Kemp's 1332 waiver, approved in November 2020 and effective from January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2026, aimed to address these issues. Under this waiver, Georgia reimburses health insurers selling individual market plans for a percentage of claims above a certain amount. This approach helped control insurer costs and resulted in lower premiums.The reinsurance program has had a notable impact on stabilizing and lowering premiums. In 2023, statewide premiums were reduced by 12.4%, while rural counties saw reductions as high as 34.3%. Additionally, increased competition among insurers further contributed to lower premiums.As of now, only one county has as few as two carriers compared to the previous situation where many had just one or two options. Sixteen percent of counties now have at least three carriers; thirty-one percent have four; and over fifty-two percent have five or more carriers operating within them. The number of carriers participating in Georgia’s individual market rose from four in 2018 to ten in 2024.Another significant accomplishment under the Kemp administration is the growth in enrollments in individual health insurance plans through Georgia Access. This state-based healthcare exchange leverages private-sector efficiencies to offer maximum choice to residents.Since its establishment, enrollment numbers have surged from approximately 375,000 individuals enrolled in plans on the individual market in 2019 to about 1.3 million by 2024—a gain of nearly one million people or about nine percent of Georgia's total population.Overall premium reductions for individual market plans during Kemp’s tenure reached twelve percent statewide and up to thirty percent in rural areas. These developments position Georgia as a model for other states seeking similar reforms.The report concludes that adopting similar strategies could help other states reclaim authority from federal oversight while enhancing their healthcare systems through private sector involvement.___",Report highlights improvements under Governor Kemp's health insurance reforms,https://peachtreetimes.com/stories/661844979-report-highlights-improvements-under-governor-kemp-s-health-insurance-reforms,2.6111026,7.067088

This move, driven by changes from the State Superintendent’s Office, is viewed by the GLBC as a detrimental step backwards in fostering diversity, equity and inclusion in education,"" said Gilliard.Local districts, including Gwinnett County Public Schools, received state approval to pilot the course during the 2023-2024 school year, allowing participating students to earn credit. However, a recent requirement for a formal course request for districts interested in offering AP African American Studies has effectively halted its continuation. This requirement was communicated by Dr. Aldridge, Deputy Superintendent, on July 10, 2024.“This decision is a significant step backwards in providing students with a holistic and diverse education,"" continued Gilliard. ""African American Studies play a pivotal role in fostering understanding, empathy and appreciation of our shared history and cultural heritage.

georgia-peachtreetimes-665259896,Peach Tree Times,2024-10-16,Metric Media Network,Peach Tree Times,Georgia,"As of September 2024, Georgia experienced a 21.8% increase in prices of goods and services since January 2021, surpassing the national average of 20.5%, according to the latest data from the United States Congress Joint Economic Committee.This rate indicates a significant rise in the overall cost of goods and services, resulting in an additional monthly cost of $1,078.The persistent increase in inflation has been driven by various factors, including supply chain disruptions, increased demand, and higher production costs. This overall rise in prices has placed additional financial strain on households across the state, making everyday expenses more challenging to manage.In 2022, the high rates of inflation significantly reduced the real value of American wages, leading to widespread financial concerns, according to Statista. Many Americans expressed anxiety over the economy and reported worsening financial conditions. The inflation crisis in the United States, mirrored globally, was largely driven by COVID-19-related supply chain disruptions and the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In June 2022, the U.S. monthly inflation rate soared to a 40-year high of 9.1%, with annual inflation for the year reaching 8%. Without corresponding wage increases, Americans will continue to experience a decline in purchasing power. Since then, inflation has been cooling at a slow pace, but it still hovers above pre-pandemic levels. In June 2024, it reached 3%, with American families facing a CPI more than 20% higher than in January 2020.Comparison of Georgia Inflation Costs by Sector for September 2024: Increase Since January 2021Total InflationShelterTransportationFoodEnergy$1,077$1,077$275$275$252$252$126$126$106$106Cost of Living: State-by-State Inflation Comparison from January 2021 to September 2024RankStateTotal Inflation Rate (January 2021 to September 2024)Extra Spending per Household (January 2021 to September 2024)1Arizona22.1%$35,0211Colorado22.1%$39,3991Idaho22.1%$32,0761Montana22.1%$33,1871Nevada22.1%$34,9351New Mexico22.1%$30,2511Utah22.1%$38,2351Wyoming22.1%$34,1229Delaware21.8%$32,6739District of Columbia21.8%$44,5569Florida21.8%$33,6969Georgia21.8%$29,5809Maryland21.8%$33,2779North Carolina21.8%$27,9919South Carolina21.8%$27,1999Virginia21.8%$31,8499West Virginia21.8%$24,45418Alabama21.8%$26,12218Kentucky21.8%$25,90618Mississippi21.8%$24,33518Tennessee21.8%$27,38822Iowa20.9%$27,69822Kansas20.9%$30,01622Minnesota20.9%$34,17322Missouri20.9%$30,30922Nebraska20.9%$30,98822North Dakota20.9%$31,25122South Dakota20.9%$31,20129Arkansas20.5%$22,87229Louisiana20.5%$25,73329Oklahoma20.5%$23,78729Texas20.5%$29,95933Illinois20.5%$31,82733Indiana20.5%$27,76633Michigan20.5%$28,71333Ohio20.5%$27,37633Wisconsin20.5%$27,87838Alaska20%$34,35938California20%$34,50838Hawaii20%$33,36538Oregon20%$26,25038Washington20%$29,42243New Jersey19.2%$30,23843New York19.2%$29,70743Pennsylvania19.2%$25,44846Connecticut17.6%$29,78346Maine17.6%$24,01946Massachusetts17.6%$31,35746New Hampshire17.6%$29,64646Rhode Island17.6%$25,60246Vermont17.6%$25,325* Rounded values for better visualization.",Georgia experiences higher inflation rate than national average as of September 2024,https://peachtreetimes.com/stories/665259896-georgia-experiences-higher-inflation-rate-than-national-average-as-of-september-2024,7.2234173,7.878729

The city's highway infrastructure, developed during the civil rights era, has played a significant role in shaping these dynamics. Infrastructure projects from the 1950s and 1960s have left lasting impacts on Black communities, contributing to economic disparities that persist today.Kevin M. Kruse's New York Times article highlights the deliberate nature of this segregation: ""The intent to segregate [in Atlanta] was crystal clear. Interstate 20 was deliberately plotted along a winding route in the late 1950s to serve, in the words of Mayor [William] Hartsfield, as ‘the boundary between the white and Negro communities on the west side of town.’” This division created physical barriers that isolated Black neighborhoods from one another and contributed to ongoing racial tensions.Highway construction transformed vibrant streets like Hunter Street into blighted areas. As Black families were displaced, their access to essential services diminished. State representative for highway communities underscores the importance of empowering residents: ""Together, the predominately Black highway communities I represent are fighting for environmental justice.""Organizations such as Smart Growth America emphasize how geographical isolation limits access to vital resources. The broader national issue of environmental injustice reflects urban planning practices that have historically marginalized certain communities.Lack of civic engagement exacerbates these challenges. A U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation survey revealed that over seventy percent of Americans are unaware of how to effectively participate in government processes. Encouraging active involvement is crucial for preventing detrimental infrastructure projects and ensuring opportunities for future generations.Atlanta's Westside neighborhoods have lost much due to past decisions influenced by elected officials at various levels. As Atlantans seek greater civic participation, understanding constitutional rights becomes vital in advocating against adverse transportation policies.As Atlanta commemorates the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, it is time to honor its Westside legacy and those who contributed significantly to its history.

Kemp, alongside other state leaders, hosted a roundtable discussion with small business leaders today in Atlanta to address civil litigation policies impacting Georgia's business climate and affordability for residents. This session is the first of three planned discussions announced by Governor Kemp earlier this month to engage stakeholders statewide and inform policy proposals for the upcoming legislative session.“A little over a year ago, I announced my intention to work toward common-sense lawsuit reform while still bringing jobs to Georgia and maintaining our position as the No. 1 state for business,” said Governor Kemp. “We took the first meaningful steps on that issue this past session through the Data Analysis for Tort Reform Act. As we move forward, I want to thank the legislature and those from around the state who have been engaged on this issue as we work together to address this growing problem.”The Data Analysis for Tort Reform Act, sponsored by Floor Leader Rep. Will Wade, was designed to gather necessary information to guide further steps in this multi-year effort. Both chambers of the General Assembly also worked on related legislation during the 2024 session, including SB 426 and SB 83.“I want to thank Governor Kemp for bringing this group together,” said Lieutenant Governor Burt Jones. “I have always supported measures to get Georgia's business community the relief it needs. We made legitimate strides last session to level the playing field when a case reaches the courtroom.”Speaker of the House Jon Burns emphasized a balanced approach: “Ensuring that Georgia remains the number one state for business while also protecting consumers' rights requires a balanced approach to litigation reform.”Insurance and Safety Fire Commissioner John King expressed appreciation: “Lawsuit abuse reform is needed to ensure Georgia and its citizens stay at the forefront of states to do business.”Governor Kemp highlighted that all sides of the lawsuit reform issue would be heard throughout this process, acknowledging its complexity but stressing its importance for stabilizing costs.Peter Skiko of the Georgia Independent Security Association commented on industry challenges: “Security companies are facing a two-pronged challenge...a growing number of lawsuits brought about by recent court decisions and an inability to find affordable insurance in Georgia’s current litigation climate.”John Sambdman of the National Federation of Independent Business remarked on financial impacts: “Frivolous lawsuits lead to higher insurance rates, which small business owners can't afford, especially with inflation driving up costs.”Matt Jones from the Georgia Association of Convenience Stores noted broader impacts: “Virtually everyone has seen premium spikes in personal insurance along with significant increases in business insurance premiums.”John Triplett from the Georgia Food Industry Association discussed operational concerns: “The increased cost of liability insurance could result in closures causing food deserts.""Alexis Kinsey from the Georgia Restaurant Association emphasized family businesses' struggles: ""The prevalence of frivolous lawsuits jeopardizes our ability to grow, provide jobs, and serve communities.""Will Wilson from Independent Insurance Agents of Georgia praised legislative efforts: ""Excessive litigation drives up insurance premiums and hinders businesses' ability to thrive.""Charles Tarbutton from Georgia Motor Trucking Association called for legislative action: ""Balance must be restored...for our state to continue prospering.""Robert Hill from Georgia Child Care Association highlighted benefits for family businesses: ""Reducing unnecessary lawsuits means we can invest more in quality, safety, and community future.""Hosted by Samson Tours, today's roundtable saw participation from various stakeholders committed to addressing these issues collaboratively.",Gov.

georgia-peachtreetimes-664499305,Peach Tree Times reports,2024-09-24,Metric Media Network,Peach Tree Times,Georgia,"The Defense Credit Union Council (DCUC) told Georgia's U.S. senators in May that proposed credit card regulations would “risk military financial readiness,” and the council is now saying the bill could “jeopardize veterans’ financial security.”The bill, S. 1838, or the “Credit Card Competition Act” (CCCA, S. 1838), sponsored by U.S. Sens. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kans.), would require banks to offer merchants at least two network options, one of which cannot be Visa or Mastercard, for processing credit card transactions. Opponents to the bill argue that if given the choice, retailers would likely choose cheaper, less secure networks for processing transactions, thereby exposing consumers to increased securities and fraud risks.  “The primary issue with the CCCA is that it would mandate banks and credit unions to route credit card transactions through the lowest-cost networks,” Haleigh Laverty, communications specialist with the DCUC, told Peach Tree Times. “This could expose transactions to increased fraud risks, as these networks often underinvest in security innovations.”In a May letter from the DCUC to U.S. Sens. Raphael Warnock (D) and Jon Ossoff (D), the council wrote, “If the Federal Government imposes price controls on interchange, credit card transactions will likely go over less secure, less reliable networks that do not provide a suite of rewards and protections for consumers.”“This is why DCUC continues to advocate for stronger regulatory measures and urges Congress to reject legislation like the CCCA that could jeopardize veterans’ financial security,” said Laverty.Georgia ranked No. 3 in the country for per-capita credit card fraud reports in 2023. That’s according to an analysis of Federal Trade Commission (FTC) data reported by WalletHub. There were 19.59 credit card fraud reports per 10,000 persons in the state.Glenn Grossman, the director of research at financial advisory firm Cornerstone Advisors, told Federal Newswire in April that the CCCA could lead to an increase in credit card fraud.“If the CCCA were to be approved, the routing of credit card transactions would move from a ‘single pipe’ to ‘multiple pipes’ of data flowing from merchants to issuers,” said Grossman. “Today, card issuers depend on the networks to profile and identify fraud. They see all the transactions on their network and have developed fraud detection capabilities that would not be possible in a fragmented structure the CCCA would create.""Grossman added that Visa has invested billions on fraud detection.“The investment builds trust and in return consumers use their credit cards,” said Grossman. ""Zero liability means something to consumers. With the CCCA, it is possible that promise is gone.""In a report released in July 2023, “The True Impact of Interchange Regulation: How Government Price Controls Increase Consumer Costs and Reduce Security,” Grossman wrote that studies show 79% of consumers choose credit cards as a payment option because of their data security.Grossman said that, under the legislation, credit card authorizations would be allowed to flow across many “pipes” which would eliminate much of the “fraud fighting value that Visa and MasterCard have implemented.”The bill would not require new networks to provide fraud detection, Grossman explained.“It is expected these new networks would rather just route data, not ensure the authorization is legitimate. It is a fraudster’s dream come true!” he said.Laverty said the DCUC concurs with Grossman's findings.""In part with privacy concerns, under the Debit Networks Rules and industry PCI compliance, the credit/debit card front of card brands, retailers, processors, and networks are not permitted to have access to, or retain, consumer-level data such as names, addresses, account numbers attached to the card,"" Laverty said. ""Only limited information is contained on the track of the card, or the chip, or in the online message.""""This is why DCUC found it equally alarming to see study proposals on 'credit and debit card user fees imposed on veterans and caregivers at commissary stores and MWR facilities.'"" she said. ""Plus, the federal government, not consumers themselves, pays these fees and should continue to do so in recognition of these heroes.""""The studies proposed within the CCCA or CCCA-like legislation would also need proper banking committee oversight if they seek to invade the privacy of veteran consumers,"" said Laverty. S. 1838 is currently pending in the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.",Defense Credit Union Council: Proposed credit card bill could increase fraud risk for Georgia veterans,https://peachtreetimes.com/stories/664499305-defense-credit-union-council-proposed-credit-card-bill-could-increase-fraud-risk-for-georgia-veterans,6.9443464,4.9979978

Brian Kemp (R-Ga.) supported a ban, and stated that he intended to ""protect fairness in school sports"" when he signed a law in 2022 reinstating the Georgia High School Association's authority to prohibit transgender athletes, according to The Associated Press. Even though the association has banned boys from participating in girls' sports, there is no state law prohibiting it.As of publication time, there are 25 states that allow boys to participate in girls’ high school sports: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin.In April of 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to overturn a lower court ruling that had blocked West Virginia’s enforcement of its law, signed into law in April 2021, that banned boys from participation in girls’ high school sports. Those court rulings are expected to be challenged.In December 2022, a federal appeals court rejected a challenge to Connecticut’s policy of allowing boys to participate in girls’ sports. A lawsuit was filed in 2022 by three high school girls against the state’s policy, saying it was unfair. Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), the non-profit providing legal representation to the three girls, said it’s considering a challenge to the ruling.“Girls deserve to compete on a level playing field,” ADF Legal Counsel Christiana Holcomb said. “Forcing them to compete against boys isn’t fair, shatters their dreams and destroys their athletic opportunities.”There has been rapid growth in diagnoses of ""gender dysphoria"" in recent years, with a Reuters analysis of Medicaid findings that 42,000 children and teens in the U.S. received a diagnosis in 2021 – nearly triple the amount from 2017.""Overall, the analysis found that at least 121,882 children ages 6 to 17 were diagnosed with gender dysphoria from 2017 through 2021,"" Reuters said.A 2016 review in the Journal of Adolescent Health called children with gender dysphoria ""singularly vulnerable"" due to high rates of depression, self-harm and even suicide. The American Psychiatric Association's ""Diagnosfic and Stafisfical Manual of Mental Disorders"" says children are not fully capable of understanding what it means to be a man or a woman, adding that most questioning their biological sex eventually come to accept it and stop ""identifying"" as the opposite one.The issue of gender dysphoria and school sports hasn't been limited to high school. In March 2022, University of Pennsylvania male swimmer Will ""Lia"" Thomas won the women's NCAA swimming championship in the 500-yard freestyle.University of Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines, who tied with Thomas in the 200-meter freestyle event at those NCAA championships, called Thomas a “cheat.”“Lia Thomas is not a brave, courageous woman who EARNED a national title,” Gaines tweeted. “He is an arrogant, cheat who STOLE a national title from a hardworking, deserving woman. The NCAA is responsible.”Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who in April 2021 signed legislation banning boys from participating in girls’ sports, slammed Thomas' participation in women's events as an effort to ""destroy women's athletics.""""The NCAA's actions serve to erode opportunities for women athletes and perpetuate a fraud against women athletes as well as the public at large,"" the proclamation read. ""Florida rejects the NCAA’s efforts to destroy women’s athletics, disapproves of the NCAA elevating ideology over biology and takes offense at the NCAA trying to make others complicit in a lie.""––Does Your State Ban Boys From Girls’ Sports?StateBoys Banned From Girls' Teams?AlabamaYesAlaskaYesArizonaYesArkansasYesCaliforniaNoColoradoNoConnecticutNoDelawareNoFloridaYesGeorgiaNoHawaiiNoIdahoYesIllinoisNoIndianaYesIowaYesKansasYesKentuckyYesLouisianaYesMaineNoMarylandNoMassachusettsNoMichiganNoMinnesotaNoMississippiYesMissouriYesMontanaYesNebraskaNoNevadaNoNew HampshireNoNew JerseyNoNew MexicoNoNew YorkNoNorth CarolinaYesNorth DakotaYesOhioYesOklahomaYesOregonNoPennsylvaniaNoRhode IslandNoSouth CarolinaYesSouth DakotaYesTennesseeYesTexasYesUtahYesVermontNoVirginiaNoWashingtonNoWest VirginiaYesWisconsinNoWyomingYes",Analysis: Georgia one of 25 states allowing boys to play girls’ high school sports,https://peachtreetimes.com/stories/664798182-analysis-georgia-one-of-25-states-allowing-boys-to-play-girls-high-school-sports,10.562899,-1.9026883

georgia-peachtreetimes-662095478,Peach Tree Times,2024-07-25,Metric Media Network,Peach Tree Times,Georgia,"ATLANTA – State Representatives Viola Davis (D-Stone Mountain), Kim Schofield (D-Atlanta), Sandra Scott (D-Rex), and Rhonda Burnough (D-Riverdale) have called for action against State Superintendent Richard Woods’ decision to block an AP African American Studies course from the state curriculum for the 2024 academic year.Rep. Davis, an advocate for educational equity and justice, strongly condemns these developments. “This decision comes on the heels of the controversial House Bill 1084,” said Rep. Davis. “In 2022, Georgia enacted HB 1084, which restricts the teaching of race-related topics in public schools by banning curricula or training programs that include certain ‘divisive concepts.’ Now, Superintendent Woods’ decision to defund AP African American Studies for 2024 worsens the already existing inequities in Georgia’s education system, particularly in underserved and under-resourced zip codes. Using race as a method of diverting attention from the inequities in funding education in Georgia is unacceptable. It’s time to end tax enslavement in Georgia. Our blue counties must take a stand and sue this red state over a green issue—funding!”Rep. Schofield echoes Rep. Davis’ sentiments, emphasizing broader implications of defunding specific courses. “If you refuse to finance AP African American Studies, then Superintendent Woods and the Georgia Department of Education should not fund any AP history studies,” said Rep. Schofield. “State legislators must demand the removal of defunding policies for all history courses in schools. All history is valuable, and if there is a cost to teach AP African American history, then invoices should be sent to all educational institutions for all AP history classes.”Additionally, Rep. Scott seeks to underscore the importance of inclusivity in historical education. “Black history is an integral part of history itself,” said Rep. Scott. “Without acknowledging and including Black history, we present an incomplete and distorted view of our past. The contributions, struggles and achievements of Black individuals and communities have shaped our society in profound ways. To truly understand and appreciate our collective history, we must ensure that Black history is fully recognized and taught in our educational institutions.”Finally, Rep. Burnough seeks to highlight a trend of selective historical representation: “Georgia’s current State School Superintendent refuses to approve the AP African American History Studies course,” said Rep. Burnough.” It’s disheartening that a former history teacher would deny Georgia students the chance to learn their own history.” She added: ""It’s also astonishing how a minority can dictate which histories matter.""

georgia-peachtreetimes-662366795,Peach Tree Times,2024-08-06,Metric Media Network,Peach Tree Times,Georgia,"As President Biden revealed new rules regarding Title IX protections in April of 2024 which redefined “sex” to include “gender-identity,” and would require U.S. schools and colleges to include males who identify as females in female specific spaces like locker rooms and bathrooms, an analysis by the Peach Tree Times shows that Georgia is one of 25 states that allow boys to play in girls' high school sports.Gov. Brian Kemp (R-Ga.) supported a ban, and stated that he intended to ""protect fairness in school sports"" when he signed a law in 2022 reinstating the Georgia High School Association's authority to prohibit transgender athletes, according to The Associated Press. Even though the association has banned boys from participating in girls' sports, there is no state law prohibiting it.As of publication time, there are 25 states that allow boys to participate in girls’ high school sports: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin.In April of 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to overturn a lower court ruling that had blocked West Virginia’s enforcement of its law, signed into law in April 2021, that banned boys from participation in girls’ high school sports. Those court rulings are expected to be challenged.In December 2022, a federal appeals court rejected a challenge to Connecticut’s policy of allowing boys to participate in girls’ sports. A lawsuit was filed in 2022 by three high school girls against the state’s policy, saying it was unfair. Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), the non-profit providing legal representation to the three girls, said it’s considering a challenge to the ruling.“Girls deserve to compete on a level playing field,” ADF Legal Counsel Christiana Holcomb said. “Forcing them to compete against boys isn’t fair, shatters their dreams and destroys their athletic opportunities.”There has been rapid growth in diagnoses of ""gender dysphoria"" in recent years, with a Reuters analysis of Medicaid findings that 42,000 children and teens in the U.S. received a diagnosis in 2021 – nearly triple the amount from 2017.""Overall, the analysis found that at least 121,882 children ages 6 to 17 were diagnosed with gender dysphoria from 2017 through 2021,"" Reuters said.A 2016 review in the Journal of Adolescent Health called children with gender dysphoria ""singularly vulnerable"" due to high rates of depression, self-harm and even suicide. The American Psychiatric Association's ""Diagnosfic and Stafisfical Manual of Mental Disorders"" says children are not fully capable of understanding what it means to be a man or a woman, adding that most questioning their biological sex eventually come to accept it and stop ""identifying"" as the opposite one.The issue of gender dysphoria and school sports hasn't been limited to high school. In March 2022, University of Pennsylvania male swimmer Will ""Lia"" Thomas won the women's NCAA swimming championship in the 500-yard freestyle.University of Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines, who tied with Thomas in the 200-meter freestyle event at those NCAA championships, called Thomas a “cheat.”“Lia Thomas is not a brave, courageous woman who EARNED a national title,” Gaines tweeted. “He is an arrogant, cheat who STOLE a national title from a hardworking, deserving woman. The NCAA is responsible.”Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who in April 2021 signed legislation banning boys from participating in girls’ sports, slammed Thomas' participation in women's events as an effort to ""destroy women's athletics.""""The NCAA's actions serve to erode opportunities for women athletes and perpetuate a fraud against women athletes as well as the public at large,"" the proclamation read. ""Florida rejects the NCAA’s efforts to destroy women’s athletics, disapproves of the NCAA elevating ideology over biology and takes offense at the NCAA trying to make others complicit in a lie.""––Does Your State Ban Boys From Girls’ Sports?StateBoys Banned From Girls' Teams?AlabamaYesAlaskaYesArizonaYesArkansasYesCaliforniaNoColoradoNoConnecticutNoDelawareNoFloridaYesGeorgiaNoHawaiiNoIdahoYesIllinoisNoIndianaYesIowaYesKansasYesKentuckyYesLouisianaYesMaineNoMarylandNoMassachusettsNoMichiganNoMinnesotaNoMississippiYesMissouriYesMontanaYesNebraskaNoNevadaNoNew HampshireNoNew JerseyNoNew MexicoNoNew YorkNoNorth CarolinaYesNorth DakotaYesOhioYesOklahomaYesOregonNoPennsylvaniaNoRhode IslandNoSouth CarolinaYesSouth DakotaYesTennesseeYesTexasYesUtahYesVermontNoVirginiaNoWashingtonNoWest VirginiaYesWisconsinNoWyomingYes",Analysis: Georgia among 25 states that allow boys to play girls’ high school sports,https://peachtreetimes.com/stories/662366795-analysis-georgia-among-25-states-that-allow-boys-to-play-girls-high-school-sports,10.562901,-1.9026176

The focus was on the Georgia Access and Georgia Pathways programs.Governor Kemp addressed the attendees, emphasizing his commitment to improving healthcare access and quality for Georgians. ""When I first ran for governor, I promised to put hardworking Georgians first,"" he stated. He highlighted the Patients First Act as a pivotal piece of legislation that allowed his administration to implement innovative policies tailored to Georgia's unique health needs.Kemp underscored the state's decision to avoid a ""top-down, one-size-fits-all approach"" in favor of treating Georgians as individuals with diverse health circumstances. He noted that since its inception, Georgia Access has provided coverage for over 714,000 residents who fall under 138 percent of the federal poverty level.The Governor contrasted these numbers with traditional Medicaid expansion projections. ""To be clear, the rosiest projections for traditional Medicaid expansion estimate 500,000 people under 138 percent of the federal poverty limit would be eligible,"" he said. Kemp pointed out that Georgia Pathways and Access have surpassed this figure by over 200,000 individuals.Kemp outlined several benefits of enrolling in private sector insurance through Georgia Access: better coverage tailored to individual needs, more options for enrollees, and higher reimbursement rates for healthcare providers compared to Medicaid.He reported significant growth in private sector exchange enrollment from 460,000 five years ago to over 1.3 million today. This includes 400,000 former Medicaid recipients who transitioned to commercial plans via Georgia Access during redetermination processes.""Through Georgia Access, 400,000 Georgians who were previously on Medicaid now have private sector insurance that provides better coverage,"" Kemp stated. He also highlighted improvements in county-level insurance carrier availability and reductions in premiums statewide and in rural areas due to reinsurance program investments.Kemp shared additional statistics: Georgia has the fourth largest individual market for healthcare coverage nationally; eligibility numbers for Pathways have decreased due to increased employment and private healthcare coverage among Georgians.""The goal of Georgia Pathways is not – and has never been – to keep hundreds of thousands of Georgians on government-run healthcare forever,"" Kemp emphasized. He stressed that the program aims to provide pathways to education, employment, and improved lives without government assistance.Kemp introduced Luke Seaborn as an example of someone benefiting from these initiatives. He expressed his desire for more families to achieve financial stability without worrying about healthcare costs.In closing remarks before turning over the floor to Commissioner King, Kemp mentioned SB 65's authorization of a state-based health insurance exchange set to launch later this year.

What is this doing? It’s sending a strand of synthetic RNA into the human being and is invoking within the human being, the creation of the S1 spike protein, which is a pathogen,” Martin told the Weston A. Price Foundation. “It’s a toxin inside of human beings.

Harris, as Vice President, spoke favorably of Australia's gun restrictions which do not consider self-defense as a ""genuine reason"" for gun ownership. As a candidate for the Democratic nomination for President, Harris told a group of Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire that she supports a mandatory buyback program for certain firearms she dubbed “assault weapons.” Bloomberg described her stance as “a more aggressive position than her main rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination,” which included President Joe Biden.According to a report from the Peach Tree Times, there are currently an estimated 350,000 gun owners in Georgia that aren't registered to vote in the upcoming Presidential election between Vice President Harris and Former President Trump.

Another rule, proposed by Cobb County GOP Chair Salleigh Grubbs, introduces stringent and potentially ambiguous reporting and reconciliation requirements that could significantly threaten counties’ ability to certify election results.Jay Young, director of voting and elections for Common Cause, expressed concerns about these changes: “These new rules would allow election board members to compromise the will of Georgia voters simply based on their own gut feeling instead of facts.”Young emphasized the integrity of Georgia's existing election process: “Let’s be clear: Our election process in Georgia is and has always been safe and secure.

""The Democrats, of course, want open borders and want an endless stream of illegal migrants pouring into the United States. This is my new acquaintance, Edwin. Say hello.""Edwin, who was unable to produce identification at two gates, was met with a firm response from security guards. ""You have to have credentials,"" one guard informed Cortes. Cortes mocked the security protocols, drawing a parallel between the convention’s restrictions and border security. ""What, you mean he needs credentials and permission to come in and get past the wall? It's like a border wall in a way, huh?"" Cortes asked.Despite their attempts, Cortes and Edwin were not permitted entry. ""We would like to get some credentials for Edwin,"" Cortes said to a volunteer handling credentialing. ""He’s a migrant from Venezuela. We figured that they would love to have a migrant from Venezuela come in.""The volunteer quickly asked Cortes to stop filming the interchange. ""We’ve been ejected from the DNC credentialing office because we’re not permitted to be here,"" Cortes said. ""Seems like the United States would use similar rules about crossing the US border.""In a final exchange as Edwin and Cortes walked away from the United Center Cortes pointed out the contrast between the Democrats’ stance on border security and their own event's access control. ""Kamala Harris has an open border. You're allowed in America. You're not allowed into her party,"" he concluded. ""Well, Edwin, we tried. Two gates, credentials 0-3, that's a strikeout.""In a post on X accompanying the video, Cortes drew a sharp comparison between how the Democrats treat security at the DNC in comparison to the nation’s borders.""The DNC is more secure than America’s border,"" Cortes said. ""When a Venezuelan migrant tried to get into the DNC, he was denied due to lack of ID, failure to submit an application, and no credentials. Why is Kamala enforcing the rules at her convention but not at our border?""Under the Biden/Harris administration, illegal immigration from Venezuela has surged dramatically, with over half a million Venezuelans encountered at U.S. borders, making them the second most commonly encountered nationality after Mexicans. Federation For American Immigration Reform has attributed this spike to Biden/Harris Administration policies, which have incentivized more Venezuelans to enter the U.S. As Harris seeks the presidency, former President Donald Trump and Republican figures have shifted the focus of their criticism to her, accusing her of mishandling current immigration issues. This change in strategy highlights her earlier criticisms of Trump’s immigration policies and her role as the Biden administration’s “border czar,” a position she has attempted to distance herself from amid the arrival of an estimated 10.5 to 13 million undocumented immigrants during her tenure.A Fox News contributor and former Trump campaign official, Cortes is spokesman for the Hispanic 100 and President of The League of American Workers.David Shafer is the Chairman Emeritus of the Georgia Republican party, having served as the chairman of the GOP from 2019-2023.

The report highlights the funds spent by wealthy special interests to promote unpopular legislative policies, such as Atlanta’s $110 million ""Cop City"" project for a police training facility.The report reveals that contractors who made sizable donations received larger payouts in city contracts. “This report is an expansive look at what we’ve seen happening in Georgia for decades,” said Keshia Morris Desir, justice and democracy manager at Common Cause. “Moving forward, we want to see people-funded elections in Georgia that lead to people-supported policies, not big-money donors influencing policy based on who can pay top dollar. We hope this research moves council members to put people first, not profit.”Aunna Dennis, executive director of Common Cause Georgia, stated, “The pay-to-play process is not new in Georgia; it’s clear that donors have too much power in politics, despite the public outcry against harmful projects like Cop City. With all of these council members up for re-election in 2025, they should not be swayed and influenced by special interest donors. Georgians deserve to know the truth about who’s funding their elected officials.”Last year, Common Cause Georgia conducted a similar report on financial contributions to former councilmember Joyce Sheperd. It revealed that Sheperd's 2021 campaign received more than 50% of her donations over $250 from real estate and construction companies totaling over $40,000. Sheperd then introduced legislation to lease land for the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center, which faced significant opposition from many Atlanta residents.A copy of the full 2024 report is available online.",Common Cause Georgia releases report on corporate influence in Atlanta politics,https://peachtreetimes.com/stories/662092056-common-cause-georgia-releases-report-on-corporate-influence-in-atlanta-politics,5.462665,-2.6281314

These contributions, along with Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America’s (HMGMA) $250,000 donation, bring the total fund to $1 million.The Well Mitigation Fund was created to ensure ample resources are available for remediation should residents experience issues with their wells due to nearby developments.

georgia-peachtreetimes-662092099,Peach Tree Times,2024-07-24,Metric Media Network,Peach Tree Times,Georgia,"ATLANTA (July 24, 2024) — Today, Fulton County Superior Court released an order once again denying the plaintiff-prosecutors’ request to enjoin the Prosecuting Attorneys Qualifications Commission. Senator John F. Kennedy (R–Macon) and Senator Randy Robertson (R–Cataula) are calling on the three district attorneys challenging the Prosecuting Attorneys Qualifications Commission to drop their case Sherry Boston v. State of Georgia after their second significant loss in court.“To continue this challenge is an injustice to crime victims in our communities as well as to Georgia taxpayers having to shoulder the expense of this frivolous case,” said Sen. Kennedy, who also serves as the Chairman of the Judicial Appropriations Subcommittee. “This is the second time these plaintiff-prosecutors have failed in court to block the law. Maybe it’s time to realize that they have a losing argument.”In response to demands from Georgians for accountability, the General Assembly passed Senate Bill 92 in 2023 creating the Prosecuting Attorneys Qualifications Commission to independently investigate complaints and discipline prosecutors found in violation of their duties. The law creating the Commission was challenged in court by four of Georgia’s district attorneys. That lawsuit failed to block the Commission from carrying out its work and was eventually voluntarily dismissed.“I authored this legislation based on Georgia’s Constitution and existing models for other commissions in this state,” said Sen. Robertson, who authored SB 92. “There are several duties for prosecutors that were already in state law but there was no mechanism for enforcement. As a career law enforcement officer, I understand how important it is for officials to exercise discretion but that does not mean they can simply ignore the law and allow crime to run rampant. These DAs should drop their lawsuit immediately.”The General Assembly doubled down on its commitment to hold rogue and ineffective prosecutors accountable by passing SB 332 in 2024, also authored by Sen. Robertson, allowing the Commission to continue its work. Shortly after the enactment of SB 332, three of the four district attorneys who originally challenged the law in 2023 filed another lawsuit trying to prohibit the Commission from moving forward. Today, the court once again denied the district attorneys’ attempt to block the Commission from operating.Sen. Kennedy added: “Reporting by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Athens Banner-Herald, and other local news sources have exposed the terrible impacts of prosecutors going rogue. It is time for this small group of district attorneys to stop listening to the pro-crime organization directing their lawsuit from Oakland, California, and start listening to the voices in their own communities who simply ask to be safe.”# # #Sen.
