NICAR 2024 | AI 303: Visualizing data with large language models

## How to use this repo

Click the button below to open this repository in GitHub Codespaces.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/dmil/dataviz-with-llms-d3)

The button should open up a GitHub Codespace (VS Code in the cloud!). It may take a few minutes to set up. Once it loads and the extensions automatically install, hit the "Go Live" button on the bottom right side of the window to see your webpage in action. The codespace will have three files in it named `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`. You can replace the content of those files with the code ChatGPT gives once you enter your starter prompt. And you can view the updated website in the window that opened up when you hit "Go Live".
